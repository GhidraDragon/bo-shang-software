So DA somethi' (Middlesex County DA Office) submitted a somethin' ostensibly in accordance with "Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure 45" and I'd instead like to introduce them to texts to their own office, as well as texts to George Ohlson, etc, and the alleged victim, etc. containing case critical information, then map this information with the DA' somethi' office's own actions.

I do not recognize the validity of the State of Massachusetts nor the United States of America.
