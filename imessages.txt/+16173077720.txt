Hi Kyle, Thanks for reaching out! I'm busy most of today so I scheduled an appointment at 3:30 so I could make time for it. I look forward to talking with you soon!

Hi Kyle, Thanks for all your help as well as the help of another advisor yesterday. (Unfortunately I can't remember her name) She was able to "merge" my application accounts so I could use the same one from 2016 even though that email has been deleted and Google doesn't allow recreations of the same gmail. I will complete my MS application soon and plan to take graded and possibly transferable graduate level classes at the Harvard Extension School this summer since Tufts only offer CS 11, 61, and 135 to non degree students. I've gotten As in 11 and 61 already and I'm on the waitlist to join 135. I'll email Professor Martin Allen when my application is near complete to get his opinion on academic enrollment. Thanks so much for your help!

I'm on the wait list for 135 131 and 111 now and I'm hoping to get into at least one. I'll probably take 2 max between Tufts and Harvard Extension
