Hey Bo, it’s Joe. I wanted to reach out before I debate Donald Trump tonight.

Believe me, I can take care of Trump on the debate stage -- I’ve done it twice before -- but there is a vital role for you to play, too.

We need a lot of donations in the hours leading up to the debate. These big moments matter more than I can even express. I really mean that.

You’ve supported me over the past year, and I can’t thank you enough. But I’m asking for your help once again.

So, I’m really counting on seeing $40 from you when I get tonight’s fundraising report from my team. Can you do that for me and Democrats nationwide? You can donate right now at the link below:
