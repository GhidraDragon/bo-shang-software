It's Joe Biden. Tonight is our most important fundraising deadline so far -- and Folks, it couldn't have come at a more critical moment. 

After the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Donald Trump has all but secured the Republican nomination for president. We all have experienced what he is capable of, which is why I had to reach out to you directly. 

We cannot afford to have Donald Trump -- whose lies brought a mob to Washington, whose campaign is all about him, whose heart isn't with the American people -- back in the White House. 

If you're with us, donate before our fundraising deadline at midnight to help Kamala and me defeat Trump again and support Democrats all across the country: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/p2p-240131-eom?refcode=d24_2_fl

Biden HQ: We hate to put this thought in your head, but we want you to remember something: how you felt the day after Donald Trump was elected president. 

Remember the pit in your stomach and the fear of what was to come. And remember time and time again how those fears were realized over the next four years.

Folks, our work is quite literally funded by supporters like you making the decision that we can't go back -- we can only move forward.

99% of people won't respond to this text, so the President and Democrats nationwide are counting on the 1% who know the stakes of this race -- donors just like you.

Will you chip in a donation now to help defeat Donald Trump?

Joe Biden here. Donald Trump just won the South Carolina GOP primary, and will be his party's presumptive nominee for president.

Last time we ran against each other, over six million grassroots supporters chipped in to fund a race that could defeat him and support Democrats nationwide. You read that right. Six million.

So, I am counting on you to contribute now: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/p2p-240225-psc?refcode=d24_1_fl

Folks, unlike Donald Trump's campaign, this campaign is about all of us. It's about OUR future together. And preserving and strengthening OUR democracy.

I'm so glad you're a part of it.

Grateful ü´∂

First and foremost, we just wanted to say thank you for bearing with the number of emails and texts we sent before our February fundraising deadline. The majority of our resources come from supporters like you contributing small amounts at a time, so hopefully they are a small price to pay to keep Trump out of the White House and reelect Joe, Kamala, and Democrats nationwide. 

Folks, now that March is here, all eyes are on Super Tuesday and the State of the Union next week. It's an important moment for our campaign, which is why we're looking to solidify our base of supporters. Will you add your name to say you personally endorse the President's reelection campaign? https://actionnetwork.org/forms/add-your-name-d24_2/

Jill Biden here. Folks, we have less than 24 hours until voters start casting their ballots for Super Tuesday. This is an important moment for Joe and Kamala's reelection campaign and Democrats all across the nation, so I have to ask: Will you make another $74 donation right now? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/p2p-240304-pst?refcode=d24_1_fl

Your $74 sends a powerful message: This grassroots movement isn't backing down. We're only getting stronger. Thank you for your support.

Hi Folks, it's Jill Biden. Joe is getting ready to deliver his State of the Union address tonight. We're proud of all that this team has accomplished, but we'll be the first to tell you that our work isn't finished. We have an election to win, voters to reach, and MAGA extremists to defeat to protect our freedoms.

So before his address, please show your support for Joe, Kamala, and Democrats all across the nation by giving $74 now: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/p2p-240307-jbsotu?refcode=d24_1_fl

Folks, I hope that you were able to catch my State of the Union address last night.

We've come so far already, and none of that would be possible without supporters like you, but we still have more work to do, Folks.

That is why my campaign is launching the Defend Democracy Fund today. If you're onboard to continue making America what it can be and supporting Democrats down the ballot, I am asking for your help. 

Please use this link to make your first $74 donation to our Defend Democracy Fund today: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/p2p-240308-jbsotu?refcode=d24_1_fl

‚õÖÔ∏è To All Of Joe Biden's Supporters, please do not click away from this important message. üá∫üá∏

President Biden is humbly asking you to donate $74 or whatever you can afford directly to reelect him and elect Democrats nationwide.

As you read this, our campaign is getting absolutely pummeled with attacks online and in crucial states by Trump and MAGA Republican groups.

If everyone getting this text donated $74 to Joe Biden's reelection campaign, we would have the resources he needs to respond without asking for another donation for weeks.

Unfortunately, not everyone gives. A lot of folks look away, waiting for others to act. 

That's why we are hoping people like you who know the stakes in this election will contribute directly to his campaign and our party today.

Our average online donation is around $40. Some give more, some give less. All that matters is that you are chipping in today to stand with President Biden after his State of the Union speech last week.

Donate to the Defend Democracy Fund here: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/p2p-240312-ddf?refcode=d24_1_fl
