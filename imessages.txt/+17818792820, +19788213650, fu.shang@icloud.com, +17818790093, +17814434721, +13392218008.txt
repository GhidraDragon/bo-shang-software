I will always love and remember and appreciate all of the support I received from PACT. Without you, I don't think I'd be in a recovery state by now. Nonetheless, I believe that therapists who specialist in trauma, then later therapists who specialize in ADHD, plus prescribers who don't see their patients at high risk, may deliver the more optimal care that I need to live a better fulfilling life. Unless I get kicked from PACT for some reason, I expect to remain with Edinburg for at minimum a few more months. During that time period I hope to develop the extremely trustworthy relationship with Kim and also get to know everyone else a little better rather than always talking about my needs. I've scheduled second opinions at Harvard Vanguard and MGH and may move if someone agrees to take me on as a client. I will always love and cherish all of the time you all spent helping me.

This is from Lifestance health detailing prescription from commonwealth psychology of dexedrine, from before I started at MGH. The psychiatric NP there prescribed 30mg/day in ER capsules. There's also therapy notes from Dr Jefferson Crowe and neuropsychological evaluation. I'm working to get the rest of my MR.
