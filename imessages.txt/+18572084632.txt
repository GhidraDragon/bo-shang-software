Hey wondering if the incentive debit for $5 per group or exercise session pic capped at $75/yr? Wondering if it’s worth setting up Apple Watch powered air picture of self while doing sit-ups and pushups maybe lounges what’s the most effective by time and any location only; don’t care to hit every muscle group or extended cardio just effective and consistent with orgasmic effort cuz u know it’ll pay off?

Hi Bo! Yes so currently the cap is at $75 per year due to state restrictions but you do continue to receive the same 5 points beyond the $75 it will be counted toward a raffle phase instead where for every 25 points you will be entered in a raffle for some cool patient supplies! I think this exercise plan sounds like a great idea if you are up for it! It’s great to be just moving around a bit and exercising to get that dopamine in!
