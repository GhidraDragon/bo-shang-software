Bo, it's Kamala Harris. I'm texting you personally with a time-sensitive request before President Biden debates Donald Trump tomorrow night. Trump and extreme right-wing outside groups have millions of dollars’ worth of attack ads at the ready -- and they are hoping we won't be able to marshal a response.

Will you please show you have Joe's back before he takes the stage by pitching in $74 to support our campaign and Democrats nationwide?

Hey Bo, it’s Joe. Hope I didn’t catch you too early. I wanted to reach out before I debate Donald Trump tonight. 

Believe me, I can take care of Trump on the debate stage -- I’ve done it twice before -- but there is a vital role for you to play, too. 

We need a lot of donations in the hours leading up to the debate. These big moments matter more than I can even express. I really mean that.

You’ve supported me over the past year, and I can’t thank you enough. But I’m asking for your help once again.

I’m really counting on seeing $74 from you over in Burlington when I get tonight’s fundraising report from my team. Can you do that for me and Democrats nationwide? You can donate right now at the link below:

Bo, I just stepped off of the debate stage. And I have to tell you this: I have never heard so much malarkey in my whole life.

Here’s the truth: Donald Trump is running a campaign of revenge and retribution. He wants to forever alter what we stand for as a country, to throw decency, honesty, and integrity all by the wayside. And he will hurt anyone to help himself. 

Will you make another $74 contribution to Kamala’s and my campaign and our party today? It's going to take a heck of a lot of resources to defeat Trump again. We need you by our side tonight.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Joe
