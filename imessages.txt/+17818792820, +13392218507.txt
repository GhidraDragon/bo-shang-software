Hi Andie,

I realize that dealing with credit bureaus or alleged creditors are probably not in your job description of a benefits coordinator. I’d be happy to accept any advice you may have but as of now I plan to see where the disputes go for 1-2 months, get as many financial records as I can without wasting too much time, then afterwards enter into a government promoted full repayment plan coordinated by the non profit ACCC. ACCC said that each alleged creditor already entered into a legal agreement to accept the plan and it would cost $230 a month with $7/account/month in fees totaling around $300, and accepting the plan usually means I could pass a security clearance background check.

However I was wondering what your thoughts are regarding applying for either SSDI or SSI? According to Edinburgh I literally have had “schizophrenia” (“F20.9” on ICD 10) the entire time I was there including up to at least 2 weeks ago. Apparently Tewksbury Hospital also thought I had “Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and other Psychotic Disorder” my entire life. I currently have 26 social security work credits in the past 10 years but should have 30 by the time my backdated 2019 taxes are processed.

Also do you know how to get on a waitlist for housing assistance or any other government benefit?

Since I’m not working yet, I view the possibility of applying for social security or getting on the waitlist for other government protection as an insurance in the best case scenario but a necessity at worst.

Thanks so much,
Bo

This webpage contains the official definition of F20.9. I suppose if I’m diagnosed with literally “schizophrenia” which probably harms my ability to receive seek proper treatment for actual deficiencies, I might as well see if I qualify for government benefits based on the diagnosis.
