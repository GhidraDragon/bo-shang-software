Good morning Bo. My name is Jude. I’m a U.S. Army recruiter at Waltham. How’s your day going going? Did you request information about the Army?

Hi Jude. My day is going well and I hope yours is as well. I did request information about the Army.

Do you have any medical condition I should know about? 

Apr 03, 2023 10:11:32 AM (Read by them after 2 seconds)

Autism Spectrum Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, ADHD, and Major Depressive Disorder. I have a history of performing adequately or better without treatment but perform best when properly treated.

You would have to be off your meds for at least 2 years before you can process

Are there waivers available or am I automatically rejected before having a chance to apply? Also which meds were you referring to?

So the Army doesn’t even have a waiver? The Air Force told me there was a waiver but I’ll be likely or automatically rejected after submitting after submitting the waiver.

We can always do a waiver, but you have several disqualifying conditions. Even if we were able to get the waiver approved for the ADHD, the major depressive disorder may be a problem because the Army is a stressful job

I know. I have a history of performing adequately before diagnosis or treatment and I don’t go through withdrawal if forced to stop.

I’m telling you from experience that the waiver will not be approved

Ok thanks for the information. Do you happen to know if the Army is required to adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements for employers? If I have a concern that current DoD policies may violate the act, is there any way I could submit a request for information or complaint?

Just Vyvanse daily and Ambien as needed

Again I don’t go through withdrawal if I stop both which I voluntarily do sometimes so I don’t become dependent on the meds and learn how to perform well without

Also I believe most cyber jobs are located in the US where access to doctors and pharmacies are readily available. I just don’t see why me or many others in similar conditions would be rejected on this alone and have concerns that current DoD policies may violate the ADA

The Army has a lot of disqualifying factors that other jobs don’t have. You get yelled at constantly in basic training while that’s not really common in other jobs. The training is designed to be physically and mentally challenging. This is the reason why they have a strong vetting process for certain conditions. The Army can’t guarantee you’ll always be U.S. while you’re serving. If you think it’s unfair, you write a letter to your congressman. I’m just telling you what the regulations say

Sorry 1 last question: according to the Army website it says: “Yes. It will only prevent you from joining the Army if you’ve been treated with ADD/ADHD medication within the last year, or if you display obvious signs of the condition.”

Do you know if it’s 1 year off meds or 2 years like you told me yesterday? Thanks so much again

Also do you know if it’s all ADHD medication including non stimulants? What about off label anti depressants?

Apr 04, 2023 12:38:44 AM (Read by them after 1 second)

And what about Ambien which I’m prescribed as needed? I’d be willing to potentially go off ADHD meds for 1 year so I can join various branches of the military

Finally if I’m off meds for a few months and display no sign of impairment (I’ve long functioned at above adequate level without meds including scoring a 2200+ on SAT), would I be eligible for a waiver?

And lastly the Army says the maximum age to enlist is 35 but for officers it’s only 31? Do you know why the officer age is lower? Would I be eligible for a waiver if I meet or exceed all other qualifications? If I have to enlist how long does it typically take to get promoted to officer?
