Hi friend! It's Kimberly with The Trevor Project. Last year, our Crisis Intervention Team served over half a million contacts. LGBTQ+ young people with at least one accepting adult in their life report significantly lower rates of attempting suicide. 

This holiday season and all year-round, be the one who creates a more supportive world for LGBTQ young people. Support us by starting a fundraiser for The Trevor Project today: http://trvr.org/fb-sms
