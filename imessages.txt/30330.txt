President Biden here. We‚Äôre lowering our ask to just $1 before midnight.

The truth is, we‚Äôre still a bit short of our goal ahead of our official FEC deadline. But what matters most to me is the number of people chipping in to reach our goals.

Please use this link if you can add $1 to my reelection campaign today:

I know it seems like $1 is nothing in the face of all the attacks against us. But here's why I am asking:

$1, because the number of donations we receive will send a powerful message about the strength of our campaign.

$1, because we need to be ready as the MAGA Right blankets the airwaves and internet with more and more attack ads against us.

$1, because thousands of people have already made their donation, and they are counting on you to join them.

Please contribute any amount -- even $1 -- to help us reach our important goals before midnight. We'll use every dollar to beat Trump and win this race.

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about the gravity of the situation we‚Äôre facing, and I wanted to share some thoughts with you.

So much is at stake right now, and there is so much to be done.

Just recently in an interview, Trump endorsed allowing states to prosecute women who get an abortion. And doesn‚Äôt rule out inciting political violence -- again -- if he loses.

That‚Äôs just part of the reason why I believe Donald Trump is the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime, and that Joe and Kamala must win.

If you knew that donating $20 would mean Trump never set foot in the White House again, wouldn't it be the best $20 you ever spent?

If you knew that $20 would help protect our democracy against Trump, wouldn't it be worth it?

Because, by the time you read this, a lot of folks have chipped in $20 of their own money.

Bo, in just over 24 hours, the American people will be watching the first presidential debate.

On one side will be Joe Biden, a leader who has created jobs, lowered costs, tackled the climate crisis, and so much more. On the other side will be Donald Trump, who is systematically ripping away our fundamental freedoms.

The contrast is clear to us, but to millions of Americans, it isn't yet.

That's why your $20 to this message is sorely needed. Your support will allow us to capitalize on this moment so we can run the ads, hire the organizers, and build the infrastructure we need to reach voters and win in just four short months.

Will you make your first $20 contribution to Kamala's and my campaign today? It's going to take a heck of a lot of resources to defeat Trump again. We need you by our side.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Hey folks, it‚Äôs Joe. Last night, I spent 90 minutes debating on a stage with a guy who has all the morals of an alley cat. 

I know I‚Äôm not a young man. I don‚Äôt walk as easily as I used to. I don‚Äôt speak as smoothly as I used to. I don‚Äôt debate as well as I used to.

I also know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.

And I know -- like millions of Americans know -- when you get knocked down, you get back up.

I would not be running again if I didn‚Äôt believe with all my heart and soul that I can do this job. Because quite frankly the stakes are too high.

Hundreds of thousands of donors have chipped in since our debate yesterday, but they are counting on more folks like you to join this effort to ensure we have the resources to win in November. Will you make your first $20 donation today?

https://m.joebiden.com/CCf7ePi0

Donald Trump and I will meet on the debate stage again in September. Until then, I‚Äôll never stop fighting for families like yours just as I have every day of my career. 

I hope you‚Äôll keep the faith and join me out on the stump. 

See you out there,

Hi Bo, it‚Äôs Julie, Joe Biden‚Äôs Campaign Manager. Did you watch Thursday night‚Äôs debate?

It was clear that there‚Äôs only one candidate in this race that follows through on his promises, lives his values, and works every day for the American people.

And that‚Äôs Joe Biden.

Right now, he needs to know you have his back in this critical moment. Without enough grassroots momentum heading into the end of the month, we won't be able to surge ahead and win in November.

Donald Trump lied over and over and over again on the debate stage.

He did not disavow the violence of January 6.
He did not commit to accepting the results of this year's election.
He did not dispute his plan to sign a national abortion ban.

Donald Trump showed us exactly who he is: A danger to democracy. A threat to our fundamental freedoms unlike this nation's ever seen in a candidate for president.

Bo, the choice in November will be between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

But the choice each of us must make is what kind of country do we want to live in -- a country where we value compassion, truth, and rule of law, or a country of division, chaos, and hate. I'm asking you to commit your time and your $20 to defeat Trump, and prevent the erosion of our hard-won progress.

Here's the best link to chip in: https://m.joebiden.com/z7R2YHi0

Not even the President of the United States.

Today's decision by the Supreme Court removes virtually all limits on what the president can do.

So now, the American people must decide whether they want to entrust the presidency to Donald Trump knowing he'll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases, whenever he wants.

Folks, it‚Äôs President Biden here with an important update. Our nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. 

Each of us is equal before the law. No one, and I mean no one, is above the law. Not even the President of the United States. 

Last night's Supreme Court decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what the president can do. 

It's a dangerous precedent. I know I will respect the limits of the presidential powers -- I have for three and a half years -- but any president, including Donald Trump, will now be free to ignore the law.

So it‚Äôs up to you -- the American people -- to do what the court should have been willing to do, but will not. Together, we must hold Donald Trump accountable at the ballot box. 

Use this link to chip in your first $20 contribution to our campaign to help Kamala and me win four more years in the White House: https://m.joebiden.com/lI8m2li0

No matter how much you are able to give -- even if it is just a few bucks -- your donation will be key to preventing MAGA extremism from entering the White House.

Biden HQ: This is bad, Bo.

The conservative Supreme Court Justices -- including three Trump-appointed justices -- ruled to grant Trump virtually unlimited immunity while in office. 

Put another way, a president has essentially a green light to *violate criminal law* while in office. This is unprecedented, and this is dangerous.

Our nation was built on the fundamental belief that no one is above the law, not even the president. So it‚Äôs on us to remember who Trump is and what he‚Äôs done, and do everything in our power to hold him accountable at the ballot box in November.

That was the case until the United States Supreme Court granted Donald Trump wide-reaching immunity for his actions as president. 

As a former prosecutor and district attorney, I know this ruling is a big deal.

We have to take seriously the stakes of this election.

The Donald Trump running for office right now is not the same one that we ran against in 2020. He is more unhinged. He is more dangerous. And he has nothing to lose.

If Donald Trump wins four more years in the White House, not even the courts will hold him back. It‚Äôs what he wanted. It‚Äôs why he hand-picked three justices for the Court who helped deliver this decision.

Team Biden-Harris: This week, conservative justices on the Supreme Court awarded Donald Trump virtually unlimited immunity for his actions on Jan. 6, when he encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol in an attempt to overthrow the results of a free and fair election.

They said he was acting in his ‚Äúofficial capacity‚Äù as president, which they‚Äôve decided gives him the ability to do essentially whatever he wants even if it means tearing apart our democracy in the process.

We all saw -- with our own eyes -- what took place on that dark day. Trump stood by and did nothing, and brave police officers died. And we know that we, as a country, cannot stand to relive it.

But if Trump is elected for another four years, it is entirely possible that we will.

Bo, it's Joe Biden. I want to make it clear: I am staying in this race, and we're going to win.

I have heard the concerns that people have, the good-faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them. But I wouldn't be running if I did not absolutely believe that I can and I will beat Donald Trump in November.

Now we must unite as a party. We must focus our attention and our efforts on defeating Trump, on defending American democracy, and on protecting people's freedoms.

I can't do it without you, Bo. If you agree with me, click below to sign your name:

There's real power in numbers, and it's important that our supporters from Burlington make their voices heard right now.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart,

Joe

Team Biden-Harris: We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre getting a bunch of texts from other groups who are using the president‚Äôs name to raise money for their own causes. So, we wanted to clear things up.

*This* is your official source of grassroots communications for President Biden‚Äôs reelection campaign. *This* is where your hard-earned dollars are put to immediate use to keep our movement running.

And right now, the President needs you now more than ever, Bo. Will you pitch in a direct donation to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and defeat Donald Trump?

You‚Äôre investing your dollar where it will have the biggest impact on protecting our democracy.

Hi Bo, it‚Äôs John Fetterman. I refuse to join the vultures on Joe‚Äôs shoulder following the debate.

No one knows more than me that a rough debate is not the sum total of a person and their record. Ninety minutes on stage can‚Äôt erase the Biden administration‚Äôs three and a half years of accomplishments.

The reality is there‚Äôs a very stark choice before us: 

Choice #1: President Biden, who has created more jobs than any president in history, passed bipartisan gun safety legislation, lowered prescription drug costs, and signed into law once-in-a-generation investments in our nation‚Äôs infrastructure.

Choice #2: Donald Trump, who is obsessed with the past, consumed by revenge, and a twice-impeached former president with 34 felony convictions.

I know which side I‚Äôm on, and I need donors like you to join me. Too much is at stake to sit on the sidelines at a moment like this. So please, Bo, pitch in $20 to reelect President Biden, defeat Donald Trump, and keep our country moving forward.

That was the moment Joe Biden asked me to be his Vice President.

If Joe and I are going to get the chance to serve another term, reaching our goals this month is a must. 

These are not arbitrary goals, they're what we need to raise in order to win.

I know you've already donated, and I wish we didn't have to ask again. But this is an all-hands-on-deck moment, Bo. Please use this link to contribute $20 to our campaign today. Our average online donation is around $40. Some give more. Others give less. All that matters is that you are giving today:

Folks -- Unlike Donald Trump, I don't work for Big Oil, for Big Pharma, for the NRA. I work for you, the American people.

My first hundred days in a second term will continue to be all about the working people of this nation:

> We're going to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.
> We're going to defend the right to vote.
> We're going to fight for Medicare and Social Security.
> We're going to make the tax code fair.
> We're going to raise the federal minimum wage.
> We're going to continue lowering the cost of prescription drugs and expanding health care.
> We're going to keep leading the world on climate and clean energy.
> We're going to make housing more affordable.
> We're going to get weapons of war off our streets and ban assault weapons.

And above all else, we're going to uphold our Constitution and save our democracy.

Bo, if you believe in our vision for America, I'm kindly asking for your $20 to help us defeat Trump and continue our progress for the American people.

Folks -- I know I look 40, but I'm a little older. And hopefully with age comes a little wisdom. Here's what I know:

I know how to tell the truth.
I know right from wrong.
I know what America stands for.

We stand for the proposition that all people are created equal -- and I'll be damned if I let Donald Trump walk this nation away from it.

Bo, I need to know: Are you with me? The only way we will win is if we work together. So, is there any amount you can spare today to help defeat Trump in November? I'm going to ask for $20, but every dollar is appreciated. I really mean it.

$20.

If you knew contributing just $20 would guarantee President Biden is reelected in November, wouldn‚Äôt you donate immediately?

If you knew that same $20 would prevent Donald Trump from becoming president again, wouldn‚Äôt it be the best $20 you ever spent?

We know $20 doesn‚Äôt seem like enough money to do either of those things‚Ä¶

But by the time you‚Äôve read this text, lots and lots of people will have already donated their $20. Now, they‚Äôre hoping you‚Äôll do the same. 

If you‚Äôre fired up and ready to chip in, you can use this link: https://m.joebiden.com/1QfuDxi0

Last quarter, Trump‚Äôs campaign brought in $331 MILLION from billionaire mega-donors and super PACs. That is a massive haul.

Joe and Kamala are counting on grassroots donors like you to chip in what you can to help us catch up. Because it all adds up, and that‚Äôs how we fund a winning campaign.

So please, Bo, help Joe and Kamala stay in the White House and send Trump a message he doesn‚Äôt want to hear: He‚Äôll never win in November.

Chip in a $20 contribution before midnight: https://m.joebiden.com/1QfuDxi1

Thank you. It means a lot that you‚Äôre with us.

Bo, it‚Äôs Joe Biden. I understand you can't turn on the television or get on the internet without seeing some pundit talking about how I need to drop out of the race.

Nonsense.

I want you to ask yourself, what have these people been right about lately? Seriously. Think about it.

They were wrong about 2020.
They were wrong about 2022.
They were wrong when they said we couldn't take on the NRA, or Big Pharma, or Big Oil. 

Forget the pundits. 

As long as we are in this together -- me and you -- not only are we going to beat Trump again this November, but we are going to go on to do what many think impossible in my second term: Codify Roe, ban assault weapons, expand Social Security, and more.

But I cannot do this alone, and I've never needed you more than I do today. Everyone is looking to see if the grassroots support we need to win is still there.

I've seen it since the debate, but we have to keep going. So please:

Can I count on you to contribute $20 or whatever you can afford directly to my reelection campaign today? The amount isn't as important as the number of people donating while everyone is paying attention.

https://m.joebiden.com/PE9gE0i0

I will never forget your support, Bo. I mean that.

Please don't scroll past this. This isn't the first time we've texted recently, so we'll get straight to the point.

If everyone reading this donated even $20, we could show everyone watching that the movement we‚Äôre building has the strength to defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box in November.

Unfortunately, not everyone gives -- which is why President Biden is counting on those who truly understand the stakes of this election to contribute.

Unlike Trump relying on mega-donors at his convention, most of our donations come from people like you chipping in what you can, when you can. We're passionate about that because it means this campaign is powered by regular people, not billionaire donors.

When I accepted the nomination for Vice President at the Democratic National Convention in 2020, I spoke about trailblazers, my family, and my admiration for Joe Biden.

Last night at the Republican Convention, J.D. Vance used that same opportunity to spread his and Donald Trump‚Äôs extreme Project 2025 agenda.

When J.D. Vance tells us who he is, we should believe him.
