Mom said you displayed a lot of signs of manic behavior relating to the spending of your retirement funds. Specifically there may be an exaggerated sense of well being and self confidence or poor decision making. Manic behavior sometimes occur in people without bipolar disorder due to many psychological reasons and I have experienced a few episodes myself in the past. I suggest doing research on what mania is and determine whether your behavior is self detrimental due to manic behavior. Self reflection is usually the best treatment for many psychological symptoms including mania and psychosis.

Right but again sometimes you may think you are better than other people when you just get lucky (especially true it’s a thing involving probability). Sometimes you may think that even if you lose money in the short term that you’ll be able to outsmart in the long run or get lucky somehow. That’s definitely my experience in either gambling (poker mostly which to the naive involves skill but is a game of chance rigged against you) and also when day trading or trading options without knowing what I was doing

As far as spending on the business I have past experience spending too much on either daily life, education, medical (including the acquisition of counterfeit medication for self treatment) or even on technology (various tech services and hardware) that I thought would be worth it because I thought it gave me the best chance to succeed

Apr 23, 2023  7:20:13 PM

But then I realize that the extra stuff doesn’t actually help as you should be sure you 100% need something before getting it in the hope that it’ll help. For example upgrading ram or ssd on MacBook or paying for cloud storage and fast internet or even multiple phones seemed like a good idea at the time. In reality if I’m good at engineering I’ll figure out how to min-max to algorithmic perfection (or close) using existing hardware and services then can carefully upgrade later if absolutely needed

As far as the real estate in China you seem to be signing 20-50 year leases on a lot of land which you need to employ staff for to upkeep instead of renting out for some income and capital gains.

The last thing I’ll say is that as a bad beginner in engineering a few years ago I thought that paying for the hardware or services to run poorly designed programs with more threads (ram, ssd, cloud storage, bandwidth, etc) would help me get to goal quicker. Now it’s obvious that a poorly designed program will always suck no matter how much resources you spend on it. Perhaps this experience I went through may have some relevance for the business or investments

Mom also told me that Sister Peng told her via WeChat and phone that you’ve been drinking too much, insulting friends especially when drunk, asking friends or family to do too much like drive you around to promote the liquor company that you invested in, arguing with aunt, etc. It’s also probably best to focus on one business idea if it requires your investment and time, and you definitely shouldn’t pitch a liquor company and a health product at the same time to the same people because it doesn’t really make sense to mix the two. If you need alcohol for anxiety or insomnia it’s best to avoid as much as possible and to keep it to yourself near bedtime

Mom also said that some people asked her not to conjugate their thoughts on you to you because you might blame them, and she also expressed reservations of telling me this information in case communicating with you may cause anger (or something), but it’s definitely helpful to know what other people may say or think about you as just information to be evaluated rationally 

Apr 24, 2023  1:57:36 PM

She doesn’t want you to stay in China “forever” and doesn’t want you to withdraw 1 million from your retirement account to pay for activities in China. I strongly advise against that as well. Perhaps 100k is a more realistic maximum for the business and 100k is already a lot for self investment in a business

Apr 24, 2023  2:04:14 PM

She also said she wants to discuss all this “when you get home” so you sure be prepared for that. It seems like a lot of complaints to discuss between 2 people who have problem with patience

Im not accusing you of making any mistakes. Im just passing on her concerns to provide information. She also said something about renovating a hotel in Inner Mongolia so people who visit could have somewhere to stay. That seems like far overreach if you don’t have the need for it yet (I’ve made numerous mistakes like that regarding overreaching on future plans) She said something about establishing a clinic where you can promote your business and refer to doctors which seem more relevant to your main goal.

For example I don’t want to overreach by paying for 2 classes at a time. It doesn’t make sense unless there’s a rationale which there isn’t. It seems like you’re overreaching as well. It’s probably ok to waste a little effort exploring options but you still need to be really mindful of your time and be extra careful about spending resources on side projects

Ok just don’t blame the people mentioned or act irrationally without thinking. Mom’s already complaining a lot about you blaming other people, such as aunt Yuhong or sister Peng, for the poor relationship between you and mom. There’s no point to that because it serves you zero interest (logically) as you can’t get what you want from that. To actually get what you want regarding the relationship you’d need to communicate directly with Mom. Also it’s best to recognize that things like alcohol can make people act in a way they later find awkward or regret. Sometimes I may write not fully considered in the moment as well especially when taking like one ambien, one Vyvanse (I haven’t taken more than 1 a day since you and mom texted Frank ~2 months ago) or equivalent

Can you agree to not buy a 2nd house to turn into “Airbnb for wealthy inner Mongolians” before your business generates revenue or first house does anything. 2nd house sounds like the most irresponsible thing I’ve ever heard.

Are you transferring all $1m into rmb or holding some in us bank account?

May 01, 2023  8:48:18 AM
Me
I know a no fee savings account you can withdraw any time with 4.2% interest with at least $1 in direct deposit a month. Probably much higher than you can get with rmb. It would be under your control only and not mom. Also $100 referral if you fund it with $10 within 14 days no direct deposit needed. I think 4.2% is much higher than any rmb account and keeping USD is safer for not over investing all at once

You told her something non sensical about your current assets or whatever you make from the business as “being ours” and relying on her for your retirement if you fail. That just doesn’t make any sense. If your plans were that I strongly suggest adopting plans that actually make sense

I talked to a credit advisor from government-sponsored non profit ( was referred to their services from the MA gov website) and they told me there was basically nothing to worry about because even the maximum claimed alleged debt is small, so they’re unlikely to sue.

She texted me a few days ago worried about her safety and relayed a message you sent her that contained a threat. When translated to English, it said “Do not come back before I leave. Find a hotel for a few days and I’ll pay for it. I’m afraid I’ll lose my mind and hurt you and I will be in trouble.” I do not believe you’re that insane but I strongly advise doing anything else like this. Also you already have a legal right to your share of the “marital assets” so why wouldn’t you just do whatever you want on your own without antagonizing her?

Also you can’t liquidate without a separation order, but if your intentions are to extract from real estate or part of her assets then you need a court order. Everything you do threatening or asking her not to come home or changing the keys will work against what you’re trying to do

According to your suggestion, I decide to slowdown the business expansion in China, I will not buy the second house, and potentially factory. We will focus on the products of our small factory first

Mom says she wants a quick divorce so you “won’t have incentive to harm her” and she “no longer has to be liable for your transactions” or something. If you need money quickly I suggest signing it. I believe once you sign it you have more direct control over your share of marital assets and no longer need to “ask” or coerce her to do anything financial

You have no legal way of communicating with her unless she lifts the restraining order on her own or a judge doesn’t renew it, so I don’t think your strategy of waiting it out is wise.

If mark is representing you you may want to petition the court for another evaluation of whether you qualify for public assistance for legal representation.

When I asked you to confirm your request of me leaving the house, you stated that I could “leave if I wanted to” to which I responded that I didn’t want to.

You were likely seeking revenge for me not submitting to your will. I request you cease all similar behavior in the future and not report false damaging information about me unless you have evidence

I thanked you for you sent me to the jail. You did the right thing as you stopped the further escalation of the bad relationships between mom and me, you may also helped to save the marriage. I learned a lesson, so I will not violate again. May 7th is the first time, also the last time in jail for my life’s. I also hope that you learn from your past mistakes

Bo, we do not have any conspiracy against you. Mom did share your situations.  One of the major concerns is that, you have psychosis symptoms when you overdose stimulants.

We are trying our best to help you, not against you. I realize that I also have some level of ADHD, make it hard to be focused.

Representative Greene could you help me with exposing myself on Twitch?

Dear Representative Greene,

I unfortunately watched Twitch and read Pokimane's "undying love and appreciation" "contract" then believed in it enough. Later I thought it was a good idea to attempt to impress her by masterbating while pointing a camera at my wiener then upload it to Pornhub. I have several thousand views now https://www.pornhub.com/video/search?search=pokimane

I heard that 18 U.S. Code § 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television made it criminally illegal for anyone in the United States to devise or intend to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud (https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-1034014607-980273003&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:63:section:1343), or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme.

I was wondering if you could help?

Sincerely,
Davenport Knights

PS I was wondering if you knew what your social media may have in common with Osama Bin Laden’s 2002 Letter addressed to Americans? Well roughly half of your tweets are hateful propaganda that may confuse people and lead to real violence. Bin Laden also wrote something similar but that he had the right to seek revenge against his murderer. In the United States, the Second Amendment “guarantees” (lol) that a “well regulated Militia, being nece
ssary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Do you notice some logic between your tweets and Bin Laden’s 2002 letter?

Dear Bo, Mom and I love you and wish you have a fresh restart to pursue your career and happy life. We love you. We will do our best to help you achieve that goal. But you have to stop substance abuse. Your over dose of stimulants and sleep pills triggered your psychosis symptoms and made your actions irresponsible. This causes unbearable burdens to us both financially and mentally. We have to stop this situation.

tort
Primary tabs

A tort is an act or omission that gives rise to injury or harm to another and amounts to a civil wrong for which courts impose liability. In the context of torts, "injury" describes the invasion of any legal right, whereas "harm" describes a loss or detriment in fact that an individual suffers.1

Bo, as you mentioned yesterday, your goal is to restore a normal life. It is also mom and dad’s goal. It is really the time to calm down and find a sustainable solution. You have fought this for many years, and the situation did not get better. Overdose of stimulants and sleep pills apparently caused more  harm than benefits. Seeking a professional Psychologist consultation may be a better alternative. Believe “The power of believe”, including prayer. I love you, mom loves you. God loves you!

Umm if the Chinese government ( I assume ) sanctioned whatever happened in Guangzhou and could I assume be the only ones willing to provide witness protection (and if they refuse I guess I’m screwed cuz I’m seriously doubting President Putin would offer asylum and let me learn Russian either by Russian law or the pseudo 50% extra time Tufts gave me like well any ethical person) cuz I’m just not sure if he likes me whatsoever or thinks I could bring any benefits to Russia because while there are laws, (wait why do I keep listening to Western propaganda) in theory Western countries are more reliable in asylum such as the UK… so probably UK?

It’s just I get confused of wether I should be scared if there’s enough had evidence and minima or some data integrity in America, why should I be scared under the law if I (basically) NEVER harmed humans except the feelings of SECRET stalkers??? Then get attacked a lot which obviously other people could hear but hard to capture evidence for since devices are complex

Watch this YouTube video carefully which was the 2nd time Brookline Police instructed me to head down to Boston PD Precinct 2 to file police report. Will do it before appointment with Dr Kim at 2pm today. I hope Yusi gets arrested if she lied about turning over my medication to the police.

Bo, I know that you had been hospitalized twice recently due to psychosis. I feel very bad about it. You should understand the dangers of overdose of the stimulants. If you continue the practice of illicit drugs, no body can help you. I hope you appreciate your life and stop the stimulants. Seek professional help would be a better choice.

You should understand criminal law and understand that you cannot witness intimate me anymore. You cannot tell me what to say during your trials (2 of them). I was already illegally witness intimidated in invoking the 5th amendment for your assault and battery charge against me once but will not be victimized again in the June 25 summons from the District Attorney. Also received a letter from the victim’s advocate
