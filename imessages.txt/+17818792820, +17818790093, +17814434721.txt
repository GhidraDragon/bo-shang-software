Prior auth for Vyvanse was approved until 5/1/2024. MGH Bressler scheduled a second opinion visit but it's not until 1/3/2024. Same doctor I saw from 2017 - 2019. Happy to sign release of info if requested

Thank you Bo - I'm in contact with Pelmeds about the Vyvanse but it wasn't delivered to us yet so we don't for today's pick up. I will text you the moment is delivered - thank you.

This happened again? Could you please ask Pelmeds if I could pick it up today or ask Kim to write a bridge script at CVS? I have made lots of time commitments to becoming a software engineer and these gaps are a serious problem

Pelmeds is a pharmacy so they should be able to fill any prescription in an hour max. Im not sure why my meds are sent there if there's multiple day delays every month. Also I already committed to spending all of Friday and the weekend working with various recruiters to prepare sample code and resume/CV as well as to wrap up some classes

Also I was told that apparently Kim prefers that I don't ask for bridge medication when she isn't available, so I'm hesitant to ask PCP for medically appropriate bridge script, etc

Hi India and Frank, 

I just wanted to mention that Ramona took care of the problem very quickly and there won't be any delay as my first dose is for tomorrow anyways when I can pick up.

Thanks again Ramona for taking care of the Pelmeds things so quickly!

Hi Bo, thank you for being flexible. As I mentioned during our conversation, I'll send you a text tomorrow morning once I actually have the medication in our med room because that would be the only way to know for sure you can pick it up tomorrow morning. 

I did send Pelmeds an email with your email address and asked them to provide your prescription history today - hope you'll receive it. Please let us know if there are any issues with that, thank you.
