Apparently you just have to learn exactly what the FCRA requires the Credit Bureaus and data furnishers (lending institutions + debt buyers) to do, then find a weakness in the furnisher‚Äôs reporting by adding your own story/evidence of how the data furnishers didn‚Äôt live up to their legal responsibilities of keeping their records accurate, to submit legally convincing disputes to the Bureaus.

If the Bureaus reject your disputes despite seeing more convincing arguments from you than the data bureaus, you could sue the Bureaus yourself if you have enough evidence to back it up. This is why it‚Äôs important to keep screenshots or even recordings every time you make a serious dispute. (Even though disputes with no thought put into them also sometimes work)

If you have to end up going to court and win your case about how either the Bureaus or data furnishers didn‚Äôt abide by FCRA requirements for accurate data only, eg Capital One not letting me report the card as stolen because they couldn‚Äôt authenticate who I was over the phone, you can sue not only to reduce the debt they claim you owe but also sue for emotional trauma of them not abiding by various regulations.

There‚Äôs so much legal research in this but ChatGPT4 is a great automated intelligence at helping. You can literally feed it a sample legal form to submit and ask it to rewrite it to emphasize certain things with the information you provide and the AI will write a great legal submission for you.

Also I temporarily hired some credit repair ‚Äúlaw‚Äù firms to help dispute and see what they can do. If they have good paralegals or AI writers they could use information I provide to submit legally convincing disputes. If they‚Äôre not that advanced and just send in generic stuff for inaccuracies they may spot or claim to spot, I‚Äôm also curious where that might take me. Don‚Äôt plan on spending more than $30 total by taking advantage of some money back guarantee offers.

Apparently 3 collections gone on TransUnion and all 6 gone on one bureau or the other but not on all 3. Experian also told me they had a 2nd social security number on my account and several different names. Very weird

Unfortunately with the income you receive from your parents you likely won‚Äôt qualify for a large SNAP food stamp amount but it‚Äôs still worth a shot if you‚Äôre interested. This is the link to the application. It‚Äôs super quick and then they will call you to schedule an appointment

Hi Andie thanks for the messages. I‚Äôll do as much of the housing application and SSDI myself or informally fill them out so you could reference next Thursday. Thanks again for your help!

I successfully applied to be added to the housing waitlist but SSA isn‚Äôt giving me the option of completing the application. It says the application was received on April 27 and review started on April 28. When I logged in on April 27 it was still asking me to fill out part 2 of the application which contains medical information.

SSA gave me a form to fill out with medical information. It was part 2 of the application but they started to process it on 4/28 so electronic submission is no longer available. Could I drop off the form to you at Edinburg?

My dad got arrested for striking my mom 3 times (I managed to block roughly 9 of them) and then threatening to murder her or if she told the police, murder her after he gets out of jail. He‚Äôs on a 15k bail and my mom needs to go to court to file a restraining order and I have to go in support of it but also to petition that my dad get some mental health treatment, since I still care for his well-being. I haven‚Äôt filled out the  SSA form yet and this new stuff (me being a victim of domestic violence, the anxiety, panic, ADHD symptoms all worsening because of this) being worsened by this. I don‚Äôt know the court time but I‚Äôll figure out a way to get the form to you

Thanks so much for your kind words, and thanks so much for your continued offers of help. I was a bit incoherent last night but I meant to say that I wanted this incidence to be listed as one of the two major triggers for my anxiety, adhd, autism spectrum disorder, and depression. The other major trigger was the Tewksbury stay like I mentioned last week. I‚Äôve gotten my Tewksbury records and could make a strong case based off of exactly what Dr Lai wrote of me, indicating malpractice that caused psychological and physical damage. For the incidence regarding my Dad, I can get a police report as well as cite the documents I submitted to the police to make my case.

Thanks so much again for your help,
Bo

Also if Edinburg wants to add the part about ‚Äúschizophrenia‚Äù I‚Äôm ok with that as well. Frank and every other medical professional disagrees with the diagnosis, and I‚Äôm certain it‚Äôs incorrect, but I mean the more conditions that qualify me for SSDI the better

Representative Greene could you help me with exposing myself on Twitch?

Dear Representative Greene,

I unfortunately watched Twitch and read Pokimane's "undying love and appreciation" "contract" then believed in it enough. Later I thought it was a good idea to attempt to impress her by masterbating while pointing a camera at my wiener then upload it to Pornhub. I have several thousand views now https://www.pornhub.com/video/search?search=pokimane

I heard that 18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television made it criminally illegal for anyone in the United States to devise or intend to devise any¬†scheme or artifice to defraud (https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-1034014607-980273003&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:63:section:1343), or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme.

I was wondering if you could help?

Sincerely,
Davenport Knights

PS I was wondering if you knew what your social media may have in common with Osama Bin Laden‚Äôs 2002 Letter addressed to Americans? Well roughly half of your tweets are hateful propaganda that may confuse people and lead to real violence. Bin Laden also wrote something similar but that he had the right to seek revenge against his murderer. In the United States, the Second Amendment ‚Äúguarantees‚Äù (lol) that a ‚Äúwell regulated Militia, being nece
ssary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.‚Äù

Do you notice some logic between your tweets and Bin Laden‚Äôs 2002 letter?
