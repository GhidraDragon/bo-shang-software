üá∫üá∏ An important message from the Democratic National Committee after last night's presidential debate. ‚õÖÔ∏è

If we're going to defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot, we all have an important role to play. Especially today.

Because as you read this, Trump is hammering Joe Biden in swing states with his first ads of the general election. That not only impacts their race, but down-ballot races in those key states.

The Democratic Party needs your help to fight back: please make a $20.24 donation to the DNC.

$20.24 to beat Trump.

$20.24 to elect Democrats everywhere.

$20.24 because the DNC is the organization best positioned to get it done. Use this link:
