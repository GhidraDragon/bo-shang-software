Good evening, my office is located at unit 17 7 Montvale ave in Woburn, our appointment is scheduled for 5pm tomorrow

Dear Sergeant Seguin,

Thanks for having a pleasant conversation and sending me the information; it was very helpful! I’d like to confirm my intention to attend our appointment at 5pm today. 

I was wondering if you could briefly summarize what I may need to do at the appointment so that I could adequately prepare or bring appropriate documents if necessary?

Thanks so much and see you at 5,
Bo

Good morning Bo, if you are interested in answering the question on if you are qualified to serve in order to project you to take our placement test, and medical physical I need you to bring your drivers license, social security card, birth certificate, citizenship documents if you where naturalized, passport, high school, and college diploma. 

May 02, 2023 10:21:18 AM (Read by you after 1 second)

If you take the placement test, and physical it is not obligating you to service.

Dear Sergeant Seguin, Thanks for your reply. My dad actually has my current passport and won’t bring it back to me until tomorrow night. I have my two previous passports including the one that was issued when I was naturalized in 2004. I have a current driver’s license, unofficial college transcript, and print-out of my current passport. But I won’t be able to get my physical current passport until tomorrow night and I have no idea how long it’ll take to get my high school transcript. Is that fine?

May 02, 2023 10:49:45 AM
Me
I never received naturalization certificate because I was automatically naturalized through my Mom (I didn’t have to go to a town hall to swear loyalty or anything) and when I got naturalized I just received a passport. USCIS says a certificate request would cost ~$550 and take 3 months. I could get a social security card after I get my passport back tomorrow, so Thursday would be the earliest, but they aren’t able to issue a card without my physical current passport because they “can’t verify that I’m a citizen and still have information from 1994 when I was 6 years old when I was first issued an SSN.

Yeah we could reschedule for Thursday. The earliest I could make it there is 2pm and I’m available anytime after. Regarding the w2 is a 1099 fine? I haven’t received a w2 for a few years mostly because I was studying or pursuing my own startup and wasn’t looking for a full time job

Sorry you explained to me about how the National Guard worked over the phone but I can’t recall exact details. Does the National Guard also have separate active duty and reservists applications like the Army does? Would I be allowed to apply for the Cyber program as a reservist applicant?

Do you mean a full time position within our Organization? 

May 03, 2023 11:26:38 AM

I wasn’t sure if there were both full time and part time positions available both within the National Guard and the Army Cyber program. On the call it sounded like you were describing a part time role in the National Guard and according to the Army’s website the Cyber program consist of some National Guard members, but I wasn’t sure if full time is required for the Cyber program.

May 03, 2023 11:28:43 AM (Read by you after 5 seconds)
+17819183280
Full time is not required in the national guard, this would allow you to get a top secret security clearance, and Pursue a full time job in the civilian world. You also could elect to come on full time in our organization but that is not guaranteed 

May 03, 2023 11:30:00 AM

That sounds optimal for me. Would I still apply to join the Cyber program as a part time member of the National Guard?

Hi I just received the new SS card. 

Also I’m in a much better position to explain the 1 fingerprint/arrest from 6/23/2020 because, unfortunately, my Dad was arrested a few days ago for allegedly assaulting and battering my mom, as well as threatening witnesses. 

I was a witness at the event (and may possibly be listed as a victim in the future) so I had to dig through old records to discover a pattern of abuse. Even though nothing happened on 6/23/2020 and the charges were dismissed, which was why I didn’t really think about it, I’m still in a much better position to explain the self-defense aspect of what allegedly took place on 6/23/2020.

May 12, 2023  1:53:04 PM (Read by them after 2 seconds)
Me
Also I’ll probably petition the court to seal that arrest early next week, which my lawyer says will very likely be granted. Sealing it means, as far as I know, the Army won’t be able to see any arrest or criminal record. It makes my application look better because one of the criteria to get it sealed is presenting evidence that im not likely to repeat being accused of any offenses. 

Regarding ADHD my prescriber wrote a 30 day supply 2 days ago, but that also gives me time to test stretches of time without the medication to be more confident in stopping without it negatively affecting my life. If I could go days or weeks without the med voluntarily while still prescribed, I think it shows that I’m making an informed decision to stop taking it to be eligible to apply for the military

I’m not sure if the National Guard actually does qualification interviews (rather than just run a disqualification check) but I have a lot of experience programming and could demonstrate many algorithmically efficient scripts that are relevant to what Cyber servicemen and women do. 

I’ve also scored in the 98th-99th percentiles on the SAT, GRE, LSAT, and GMAT so I feel confident in my ability to nail the ASVAB

I’ve tried a few days off Vyvanse and I’m learning better how to deal with the withdraw effects as well as operate well after the effects are gone. I think I’ll be off for at least a month before my current prescription runs out, which I was told was the earliest you could submit a waiver. I am of course totally free of illicit substances including marijuana.

Perfect, we also have to make sure it isn’t in your system. I imagine it is amphetamine 

May 15, 2023  8:11:22 PM
Me
Yep Vyvanse metabolizes into an amphetamine, but amphetamines mainly come from legally prescribed drugs while the “street adderall” consist of mainly meth (+whatever else drug dealers put in). Synthesizing non-meth amphetamines in a lab is hard which is why drug dealers sell meth. I certainly won’t ever test positive for meth and after 4 days off Vyvanse I’ll test negative for amphetamines as well.

Also I forgot if I needed character references, but one could be from my local police department or any other department who was satisfied with my recent work. I’ve provided several law enforcement agencies with IT security recently, since after going through PTSD from my dad I built an application to auto analyze all laws, all publicly available case laws, “learn” how they work through large language NLP models, takes in user reports/evidence, then generates responses based off what the ML model returns. I’ve also built in features to auto-report to local police departments, the FBI, etc. by either auto-phone abilities or auto-browser navigation for online reports. During this process, I discovered several security vulnerabilities that my local PD, various other PDs, and the FBI have in their system, so I contacted their sys admins, gave them my scripts + a demo YouTube video, and asked them to fix their vulnerabilities.

May 15, 2023  8:17:03 PM (Read by you after 2 seconds)
+17819183280
I’m sure they will give you a professional reference 

May 15, 2023  8:20:59 PM
Me
Yea that’ll be great if someone dose. I’ll put more effort in getting a good one by contributing as a random citizen toward at least their cybersecurity needs. Perhaps they’ll find the auto-crime detection and reporting tool useful too. I’m not sure who else may serve as a good character reference. I’ve never really had to think about character references before since I usually need professional or academic references. My LinkedIn is https://www.linkedin.com/in/bshang165/ and Github is https://github.com/ I was wondering if you may have a type of person in mind who would look good on my application to the National Guard?

Yeah that part is hard after excluding family and friends; I suffered through some mental health problems over the COVID period so lost track with a lot of former employers/colleagues/teachers, etc. I’m making a lot of valuable contributions now to various people, and will start an online MS MS at Tufts at the same time as a graded (A-F) Graduate Certificate in Data Science at Harvard. The Harvard credits are transferable to Tufts so I should get it done by Dec 23 or Jun 24. I think I can get decent references from these positions even if not ideal.

May 15, 2023  8:43:05 PM

The only other hard part is the address verification, since for the 2013 - 2014 address I don’t even remember who the landlord is much less anyone else. In 2015 - 2016 I was in Australia for graduate school so could probably use their number as verification. In 2017 - 2019 I rented a room designed for graduate students at tufts, but the landlord was a roommate, and I don’t remember any neighbors. For my present residence from 2020 I could just ask a random neighbor. I might just use any banks or utility companies that mailed me stuff for the 2013 - 2014 and 2017 - 2019 addresses since I can’t think of anyone else to use

I submitted a medical records update request after speaking with my psychiatrist who said that no diagnosis for any mental health problems whatsoever may be appropriate for my present health. I’m hoping they process the request by the time MEPS requests records. Sealing the charges from 6/23/2020 require an actual hearing but I’m hoping that gets done by the time of the waiver, assuming MEPS approves the medical evaluation and I pass for everything except ADHD.

Jun 05, 2023  3:09:32 PM

Did you hear anything from MEPS yet about the physical? 

Every recruiter from the other branches told me it would take 1 year of ADHD meds. I’m not sure if the National Guard has slightly different rules since they’re both a Federal and State employer, but I definitely understand not qualifying. 

If I didn’t qualify I still very much appreciate your help throughout the process and also your service to our country and to freedom around the world.
