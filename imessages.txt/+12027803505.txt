Bo - Is there ANYTHING we can say to convince you to make a contribution to the Democratic National Committee before tonight's debate?

What if we told you Donald Trump just launched his first general election ads in swing states across the country?

What if we told you those ads will not only impact the presidential race, but Democrats in states that determine control of the House and Senate?

And what if we told you that this week is also an FEC deadline and that everything we raise (and Trump and the RNC) will be public. Everyone will be watching -- especially with the debate tonight.

This is an all-hands-on-deck day for Democrats. Joe Biden needs you. Candidates up-and-down the ballot need you. 

Can Joe Biden and Democrats everywhere count on you to make a contribution directly to the Democratic National Committee today? Every donation ‚Äì no matter the amount ‚Äì means a lot.

üá∫üá∏An important message from the Democratic National Committee about President Biden‚Äôs reelection. üå§Ô∏è

A short while ago, President Biden and Vice President Harris got on a campaign all-staff call and ended any speculation by the pundits about his future.

He's staying in. He is the leader of the Democratic Party.

And if we're with him, not only is he going to win, but we are going to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this fall. What do you say?

Can Joe Biden and Democrats EVERYWHERE count on you to make a contribution of $5, $25 or whatever you can directly to the Democratic National Committee today? Use this link:

Bo, with Trump's announcement of J.D. Vance as his VP running mate, we're humbly asking -- is there anything we can say to convince you to make a contribution to the Democratic National Committee today?

Please.

$20 or more to stop Trump and Vance from getting into the White House.

$20 or more to make sure we have the resources to elect Democrats up and down the ballot.

$20 or more because our FEC deadline is in 5 days and we need to make the strongest showing possible after this news.

Democrats across the country are donating their own $20 in record numbers in response to this announcement. Now they're counting on you to join them.

For Joe Biden. For Democrats everywhere. For our democracy. Add your donation here:
