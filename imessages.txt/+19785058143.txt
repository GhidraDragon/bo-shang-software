Hi George,

I hope you are doing well. Sorry I wasn’t able to make it last week because for some reason I got no sleep the night before so I wasn’t functioning properly. I was able to come today and I’d be happy for a meet if you’re available.

Thanks so much,

My dad was arrested after he attempted to strike my mom roughly a dozen times(I intercepted around 9 and 3 landed) and after he threatened to murder her or if she calls the police, murder her after he gets out of jail. I hope he learns a lesson then gets off as lightly as possible, but he wouldn’t listen to me when I kept trying to explain what’s legal and what’s not. Thanks so much for you and Pastor Yi’s help!

Hi George,

Unfortunately I had to go to the ER at 3am today because viral pharyngitis was causing me breathing problems. I was released a few hours ago but still feel a lot of pain and could barely breath. Therefore I won’t be able to make it to church today.

I look forward to meeting with you at a later time. Thanks so much for your help.

Hi George, I know I’ve canceled several times already, but I should tell you basically why. I’ve been working hard to come up with the best legal argument and automated tools to help society discover one type of cancer in one social media website. This website isn’t updated very well, but it roughly explains what I’ve been trying to do over the past 3 weeks. I think that public understanding of Twitch is not only important but also beneficial to my career and mental health, so I’ve been working hard on it and hope to wrap things up by the end of June.

What have you learned here compared to what you learned watching a Twitch stream? Think about this question. Twitch is potentially growing at a ~n^n rate by trying to convince an entire population to adopt a non-productive (at best) or criminal (often) lifestyle. They are just not a sustainable use of human potential. 

Someone should tell the Congress, the President, and the FBI, (and whomever) that network complexity has gotten too complex. There is simply zero regulation or enforcement on parts of the Internet and that has not only made criminal violations absurdly prevalent across the Internet, but has also significantly harmed the lives of many particularly young and vulnerable people. Congress should figure out a way to reduce network complexity so people can get back to how "normal" people used to live before the Internet became so prevalent, when abuse and mental health wasn't so widespread.

尊敬的中国国家安全部，
 
我叫尚博，我出生在中国，仍然有很多朋友和家人住在那里。 我一直非常尊重中国人民，因为中国人互相关心，一般不会故意对他人造成伤害，尤其是大规模伤害。 我六岁时，我的父母把我带到了美国。
 
我一直想要更好的方式与我的根建立联系，所以2011年我在上海的投资银行工作了一年。除此之外，我也去过几次，包括最近一次是为了我的外祖父的去世，他是一位忠诚而优秀的中国共产党党员。
 
与美国政府不同，我并不敌视中国政府。 我读了很多中国政府写的材料，我相信中国政府正在通过对世界运作方式的了解，尽最大努力帮助中国人民和世界人民。 我背包旅行过很多地方，了解还有多少其他国家也在工作。 美国政府经常用自己的宣传来虐待自己的人民，表明美国知道如何做好每件事。 我敢打赌，如果普通中国人知道我是如何将自己的能力发展到如此高的技术水平，从长远来看，中国很可能会超越美国。
 
我相信我是一位非常有才华的计算软件工程师，尽管我对各种硬件和科学的理解也不错。 最近，我只花了几天时间编写代码，并花了一个月的时间在网上侮辱美国人，因为他们让 Twitch 网络继续存在。 目前，我已经以算法最高效的多线程方式获取了所有公开的最重要数据，并使用人工智能驱动的自动化电子邮件向所有人（包括 Twitch 员工和主播）通报 Twitch 犯罪行为。 我还开始在 Twitch 网络中启动机器人来帮助他们自证其罪，但我可以将这些人工智能驱动的机器人用于任何目的。 我目前正在使用我收集的数据构建专有的机器学习模型。 此外，我相信我有能力以类似的方式渗透任何社交网络。
 
如果我全神贯注于某件事，我相信我能够以合理、最佳、快速和诚实的方式完成它。 我默认对所有人都抱有深深的正直和尊重，除了那些不尊重数百万受害者的连环病态罪犯。
 
我认为 Twitch 对中国构成了严重的国家安全威胁，因为 Twitch 试图通过其法律文件向所有人谎报 Twitch 的实际行为，从而合谋进行诈骗犯罪活动。 Twitch 充其量只是试图说服整个社会采取一种完全毫无价值的生活方式，而且 Twitch 常常说服人们采取犯罪的生活方式，并对用户造成大量的心理健康损害和欺诈。
 
对中国来说幸运的是，中国明智地禁止了 Twitch。 不过，我建议中国留意其他潜在的“欺诈性多巴胺”软件。 人们想要真正的长期幸福，我称之为“真正的多巴胺”。
 
Twitch 是美国的敌人，是其开展业务的每个国家的敌人，也是严重侵犯人权的行为。
 
我目前正在构建普通的软件产品，同时也在开发网络战技术。 我计划尽可能多地学习网络、网络技术、操作系统、固件、硬件和位级人工智能，以创建最有用的普通产品以及潜在的军事级技术。
 
由于我是美国公民，我必须遵守美国法律（直到我放弃公民身份或其他什么），但如果国家安全部有任何同时遵守美国和俄罗斯法律的合法要求，我会很乐意考虑。
 
由于我持有有效的中国签证，我正在考虑在飞往中国后申请庇护。 不过，在华盛顿特区大使馆办理可能会更容易。
 
尊敬，
博

3pm is fine. I do have to finish a civil lawsuit draft vs Twitch. This is the main point I was trying to make: The Plaintiff believes that in any law-based society, whenever anyone intentionally causes harm to another, then that person has committed criminal violations. This is because most common-sense criminal laws, such as fraud through fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, have already been codified into law, often long ago. The Plaintiff believes that if someone witnesses another person intentionally doing harm to others, then that witness simply needs to look up applicable criminal law before reporting to the police. The Plaintiff is disturbed that a judge at the California Superior Court at San Francisco reported neither James Varga nor Twitch Interactive to the police, when Varga’s criminal violations should have been super obvious to any judge.

How have you been doing? I would want to arrange an appointment to meet with you. Would you go to church to observe your mother’s baptism this Sunday afternoon? If you do, we can observe together and talk thereafter. If not, I can go to your home to meet with you after the baptism.

Representative Greene could you help me with exposing myself on Twitch?

Dear Representative Greene,

I unfortunately watched Twitch and read Pokimane's "undying love and appreciation" "contract" then believed in it enough. Later I thought it was a good idea to attempt to impress her by masterbating while pointing a camera at my wiener then upload it to Pornhub. I have several thousand views now https://www.pornhub.com/video/search?search=pokimane

I heard that 18 U.S. Code § 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television made it criminally illegal for anyone in the United States to devise or intend to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud (https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-1034014607-980273003&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:63:section:1343), or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme.

I was wondering if you could help?

Sincerely,
Davenport Knights

PS I was wondering if you knew what your social media may have in common with Osama Bin Laden’s 2002 Letter addressed to Americans? Well roughly half of your tweets are hateful propaganda that may confuse people and lead to real violence. Bin Laden also wrote something similar but that he had the right to seek revenge against his murderer. In the United States, the Second Amendment “guarantees” (lol) that a “well regulated Militia, being nece
ssary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Do you notice some logic between your tweets and Bin Laden’s 2002 letter?

I’m not sure if the red dot video recording has sound; if not then Apple hacked again to remove the sound which is easy but there might be another copy send to my Mom and Dad which has sound so I have to make another copy. (See this is how a digital cover up works once it hits the network) anyways please spread this around as much as possible. I might as well publicly upload every photo and document etc to make this easy and also curate, for human rights around the world, because North Korea is a Korea, so is the South, and everyone hates criminals, even Americans presumably 🤔

I mean there are older iOS builds rather than swiftUI so you need to look at which APIs are available, then I guess reverse it software level on Google Maps if it was them which has to be possible… unless Apple really locked it down….

Investment opportunity for PDFSage, from an Engineering alum


Dear investmentpartners@invoff.trustees.tufts.edu,

I am writing to introduce you to PDFSage Inc., a Delaware C Corp registered in December 2024. I am Bo Shang, an Engineering alum of Tufts University, and I currently own 100% of the equity in PDFSage.

PDFSage is building a central documents hub and is exploring expanding this to include photos. We have quality starter code available on Github. Our focus is on creating AI-powered solutions, and we are currently developing AIController, a TFLite model designed to control all things AI, that runs on mobile SoCs.

This morning, we successfully trained and deployed a "stupidity detect" TF-node model in just 2 hours. While training on a mobile 4070 took only half a second, AWS Amplify indicates the model is too large for deployment.

In the past two days, PDFSage has released two iOS apps: one for all things PDF, which supports bulk action and watermarking, and another called Info & Tools, which we believe is the most advanced Swiss Army Knife app on the iOS platform, fully utilizing all sensors and SoC capabilities.

PDFSage is eager to succeed and welcomes any helpful advice. However, we are also confident in our ability to achieve our goals, even with AFK investors.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Bo Shang

1.1 only; 1.0 sucked but

1.1 coming up with TFLite AIController to control all things...

EXHIBIT 8: On January 9 2025, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the US District Court of Northern California granted literally 100% of the Plaintiff’s (Bo) request in a Motion to Amend or join Apple and Google in a lawsuit vs Twitch. The defense attorneys argued for a rejection of the motion with prejudice, and lost horrifically in their ad-hominem attack

EXHIBIT 9: On January 12, 2025, Plaintiff Bo filed a Motion to Amend joining Apple and Google in his lawsuit against Twitch, in an effort to defend the rights of Americans and Internet users around the world

I Bo Shang, on today January 25 2025, swear under perjury that nearly 100% of the motivation of filing these lawsuits is altruism and to defend the rights of Americans and communities around the world. In mid 2023 President Biden wrote to Bo regarding these abridged rights, and now Bo is taking action.
