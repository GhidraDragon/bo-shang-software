Biden HQ here: Folks, we wish we could fly out this entire grassroots team to NYC to our Evening with the Presidents event -- but since that’s not possible, we have the next best thing. 

If you chip in $25 right now, you can:

✅ Join our exclusive virtual event (with Joe, Barack, and Bill)
✅ Submit your burning questions for the three presidents to answer

Folks like you are the backbone of our campaign, so we wanted to make sure that our most dedicated grassroots donors still had an opportunity to tune in from home.

Here’s the link to chip in and secure your spot: https://bfptxt.com/37YPGP

Bo, you've made 6 donations to Team Biden-Harris so far. You’ve had a huge impact on our success. So, we wish we didn't have to ask for one more contribution -- but this is important.

As you read this, President Biden is getting absolutely hammered with attacks online and on television. 

And we know that they are just getting started -- and that the GOP super PACs spending against us will only heat up. 

That’s why Joe needs your help:

You made your last donation on March 12, 2024 and have given $30.98 online this cycle to date. That makes you one of the President's top supporters. 

But if we are going to reach our goals and keep Trump out of the White House this November, the President needs you again.

Please use this link to make one more contribution. $1.69 would mean the world to our chances.

Donald Trump is down in Florida today raising money from a bunch of hedge fund billionaires who want him to cut Social Security and Medicare and give them tax cuts. So, I figured there was no better day to send you a message about exactly who is funding our campaign than today.

Over 1.6 million donors have contributed to support my campaign and our party so far. And, last quarter alone, these donors contributed over $187 million. That’s incredible, folks.

I’ve always said this campaign is Scranton versus Palm Beach, but these numbers really show that. Our campaign is a grassroots movement made up of nurses and teachers. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is collecting checks from a couple of billionaires who are looking for a tax cut.

Real people like you who know the stakes of this election. You are rolling your sleeves up to pitch in what you can. And, whether you give $1 or $100 to our campaign, you’re making a real difference.

I know that you have already made a contribution to our campaign this cycle, and I cannot thank you enough for it. But, as you know, we cannot afford to cut it close this year. Will you pitch in another $74 today to make sure we defeat Donald Trump and his billionaire backers? Whatever you pitch in will go a long way in making sure we do not fall short come Election Day: https://bfptxt.com/3jQtbK

More soon,
Joe Biden

Team -- it's Kamala Harris.

Donald Trump is telling the truth about his plans for a second term:

He said he will “terminate” the Affordable Care Act.

He wants to enact a national abortion ban.

He said he will be a dictator on “Day One.”

There is only one thing standing in his way -- and that is people like you who know the stakes of this election, and who are willing to act to make sure he never steps foot in the White House again.

Joe and I need you, team. Will you use this link to contribute $74 to our campaign and our party today?

Bo -- Joe Biden here. I'm told you've made 6 donations to support our party and my reelection campaign against Trump. Thank you.

I truly wish I didn't have to ask you to make one more donation today, but this is important.

Donald Trump just raised $50 million in one day. Between that and attacks heating up against us, I really need your help.

Our records show you made your first donation on March 12, 2024 and have donated $30.98 so far. Again, I can't thank you enough.

But if we are going to reach our goals and beat Trump in November, I need you one more time. 

Please use this link to make another donation. $1.69 would help ensure we don't fall behind Trump, and it would mean the world to our chances.

President Biden here. We’re lowering our ask to just $25 before midnight. 

The truth is, we’re still a bit short of our goal ahead of our official April deadline. But what matters most to me is the number of people chipping in to reach our goals.

Please use this link if you can add $25 to support my reelection campaign and our party today: 

https://bfptxt.com/3G4WdM

I know it seems like $25 is nothing in the face of all the attacks against us. But here's why I am asking:

$25, because the number of donations we receive will send a powerful message about the strength of our campaign and our party.

$25, because we need to be ready as the MAGA Right blankets the airwaves and internet with more and more attack ads against us.

$25, because thousands of people have already made their donation, and they are counting on you to join them.

Please contribute any amount -- even $25 -- to help us reach our important goals before midnight. We'll use every dollar to beat Trump and win this race.

Bo, you made your last donation on March 12, 2024 and have given $31 online because YOU believe in the President’s vision for our country -- and that there is no task more important than defeating Donald Trump.

That makes you one of the President’s top grassroots donors. 

As you may know, we have less than six months left in this campaign. That’s just six months to reach and register voters, all while fighting back against Donald Trump’s endless attacks, lies, and big spending.

So, there couldn’t be a more critical time for you to step up once more and show your support for Joe, Kamala, and Democrats. Will you match your last donation of $2 and chip in again today?

Bo, you made your last donation on March 12, 2024 and have given a total of $40 online since the launch of President Biden’s reelection campaign. 

YOU believe in the President’s vision for our country -- and that there is no task more important than defeating Donald Trump.

That makes you one of the President’s top grassroots donors. 

Right now, we’re asking you to step up once more and rush your support. Donald Trump’s campaign raised almost $70 million after he was found guilty on 34 felony counts. And if that wasn't bad enough, new reporting revealed a mega-donor gave $50 MILLION to Trump's super PAC.

Bottom line: There couldn’t be a more critical moment for you to match your last donation of $40 and power President Biden’s reelection campaign and Democrats nationwide. Will you chip in again today?

Hey folks, it’s Joe. Last night, I spent 90 minutes debating on a stage with a guy who has all the morals of an alley cat. 

I know I’m not a young man. I don’t walk as easily as I used to. I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to.

I also know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.

And I know -- like millions of Americans know -- when you get knocked down, you get back up.

I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul that I can do this job. Because quite frankly the stakes are too high.

You’re one of my campaign’s strongest donors. It’d mean a lot to me to see another donation from you come through for my reelection campaign and our party today.

https://bfptxt.com/5fnPsP

Donald Trump and I will meet on the debate stage again in September. Until then, I’ll never stop fighting for families like yours just as I have every day of my career. 

I hope you’ll keep the faith and join me out on the stump. 

See you out there,

Joe

BREAKING: The Supreme Court just granted Donald Trump breathtaking immunity from prosecution.

We cannot overstate how unprecedented this ruling is. One of the dissenting opinions states if the president “[o]rders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival” they will be “Immune.”

If Trump wins again, he’ll be even more dangerous and unhinged because he knows the courts won’t hold him back.

This team must hold Trump accountable. Our democracy and ALL of our fundamental rights hang in the balance. Rush another $74 now to defeat Donald Trump once and for all >>

https://bfptxt.com/5v3tb5

The highest court in the land just gave Donald Trump what he wanted. You better bet he is going to fight tooth and nail to get back in the Oval Office. 

Donors like you are the ONLY thing standing between Donald Trump getting four more years in the White House.

Thanks for being with us in the moment,

Bo, it’s Joe Biden. I understand you can't turn on the television or get on the internet without seeing some pundit talking about how I need to drop out of the race.

Nonsense.

I want you to ask yourself, what have these people been right about lately? Seriously. Think about it.

They were wrong about 2020.
They were wrong about 2022.
They were wrong when they said we couldn't take on the NRA, or big Pharma, or Big Oil. 

Forget the pundits. 

As long as we are in this together -- me and you -- not only are we going to beat Trump again this November, but we are going to go on to do what many think impossible in my second term: Codify Roe, ban assault weapons, expand Social Security, and more.

But I cannot do this alone, and I've never needed you more than I do today. Everyone is looking to see if the grassroots support we need to win is still there.

I've seen it since the debate, but we have to keep going. So please:

Can I count on you to contribute $74 or whatever you can afford directly to my re-election campaign and our party today? The amount isn't as important as the number of people donating while everyone is paying attention.

Bo, you've made 6 donations to Team Biden-Harris so far. Thank you. We wish we didn't have to ask for one more contribution, but this is important. 

Please let us explain:  

Conservative justices on the Supreme Court just decided that presidents have virtually unlimited immunity for crimes committed while in office. This decision removes one of the last remaining checks to limit what a president -- say Donald Trump -- can do. 

Look, we’re talking about a man who encouraged a violent mob to storm the U.S. Capitol to stop the peaceful transfer of power. We all saw it with our own eyes. 

Now he’s doing whatever he can to get back in the Oval Office, and it’s up to us to stop him.

There couldn’t be a more critical moment for you to match your last donation of $2 and power the President’s reelection campaign and Democrats nationwide. Here’s the best link to give again:

Bo, it’s Joe Biden. I want to make it clear: I am staying in this race, and we're going to win.

I have heard the concerns that people have, the good-faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them. But I wouldn't be running if I did not absolutely believe that I can and I will beat Donald Trump in November.

Now we must unite as a party. We must focus our attention and our efforts on defeating Trump, on defending American democracy, and on protecting people's freedoms.

I can't do it without you, Bo. If you agree with me, click the link below to sign your name:

Kamala here. Bo, Donald Trump just announced J.D. Vance as his running mate.

Announcing a running mate is a big deal. The day that I got the call from Joe asking me to be a part of the ticket was one of the most memorable days of my life. Not only that, it was a massive moment for our campaign.

Millions of grassroots supporters decided to volunteer their time and their hard-earned money to support Team Biden-Harris because they believed in our vision. And ultimately, we won. 

But now that Donald Trump has announced J.D. Vance is joining the ticket, we need your support more than ever before.

Joe and I are counting on grassroots donors like you to make another gift to our campaign and our party today to meet the moment. Will you rush $74 now?
