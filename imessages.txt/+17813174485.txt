"Hi, my name is Andrew. I am uh a therapist from Advocates Community Counseling and uh just giving you a call. I know it looks like you had, um, come here for services and uh you had done an intake with someone and uh a little while ago and were interested in some ongoing therapy services. So I wanted to see if you wanted to uh schedule a time to meet with me uh for therapy, either on zoom or in person. Um, I have some uh open availability that I'd be happy to discuss with you. So if you wanna just give me a call back at this phone number to reschedule or let us know if you have any change in your uh preference for therapy. Um, just give us a call back at this number. Thanks. Bye."
