Dear Attorney Ohlson,

It was nice seeing you again a few days ago. I have been doing much better since you got my case dismissed and I hope you are doing well as well. 

I have requested and read through all the documents Woburn District Court has made available to me, but I was wondering if I could also request a copy of any other documents you may have held onto for my case?

I really want to learn more about what happened to me and some documents you provide may be used as evidence for unrelated legal claims in the future.

Thanks so much again for your help! My Dad claimed to have tried to get the case dismissed as soon as possible, claimed to have issued several statements inconsistent with what was written in the police report to the judge, but as far as I know never told the ADA he was wasn’t willing to testify or that he would rather testify on my behalf. I think my Dad was confused of how the legal process worked and so the way you got my case dismissed was my best possible outcome.

I’d be happy to pay any costs associated with your records retrieval.

I can accept the documents in any form, but an email to bshang165@gmail.com may be convenient.

It was very pleasant to see you again,
Bo

Awesome great thanks! Please let me know where to send payment for the information retrieval. Also I’m guessing that my charges were dismissed without prejudice? It’s not clear on the “disposition” part from Woburn District Court but I’m guessing it has to have been dismissed without prejudice?

Awesome thanks! The last question I have is whether my case qualifies, for the purpose of sealing records, as “Dismissal without probation entered by a court” if it was dismissed at the end of successfully completing probation? The clerks office told me “probably” but I’m still unclear what that phrase means.

I just called the victims advocate and informed her that my dad says he “doesn’t care about what happens in the trial”, “doesn’t care if he goes to jail” and “wants to represent himself.” Besides this his other decision making abilities are seriously impaired and the continuation of unstable thoughts continue to harm myself, my mom, and our family/friends. 

I told the victims advocate that if a judge grants my dad’s waiver for self representation then I’ll almost certainly file a lawsuit invoking his 6th amendment rights since I have thousands of recent text messages and other hard evidence proving that he’s incapable of making informed choices and must be represented by a lawyer according to the 6th. If it comes to that, 

I’d be happy to pay a 5-10k retainer (then billed hourly or whatever) for that lawsuit to protect my dad from himself. It also protects public resources because any trial where my Dad represents himself would certainly be deemed a mistrial upon further investigation.

My dads ability to make informed choices are worth much more than 10k to our family so my mom is willing to contribute. It’ll be to her advantage to pay 10k for my dad to try to regain sanity. I don’t think you’re allowed to represent my dad due to conflicts of interest but I believe I could file suit on his behalf because violation of his 6th negatively affects me.

My dad says he can’t afford to pay for a lawyer because he doesn’t have any money and can’t access marital assets without my mother’s permission. I’m not sure what he said during the bail hearing to get denied public assistance but a lot of the things conveyed by his lawyer for the bail hearing were factually incorrect.

I informed the patient advocate that I may invoke my 5th amendment rights depending on how my dad does, and she says it’s up to the ADA and my dad’s attorney but I cannot “just invoke it.” So I’m pretty sure a court would assign you to represent me for that matter. The 5-10k that I mentioned earlier would come from my mom so I’d still qualify for public assistance

Statements to the Victim’s Advocate about possibly invoking my 5th as well as Americans with Disabilities Act rights to not testify. Previously I submitted hard evidence, including police reports, to her and to the police about incidents when my Dad’s pattern of abuse from 9/28/2019, 3/3/2020, 5/7/2023, and 5/12/2023. This evidence doesn’t necessary prove self defense for my charges but would likely be considered a mitigating factor.

My dad got aggregated again last night for I believe (I don’t know any charges myself; the victim advocate seems hesitant to speak to me after I asserted many of my rights through written text) alleged sexual assault on my mom and criminal restraining order violations. He’s asking me for $2600 bail, but I believe he should be sent to a mental health hospital for treatment/evaluation since I believe he’s in no shape to stand trial and certainly in no shape to represent himself. Since he has no lawyer nobody is there to recommend an evaluation for him. Regarding the lawsuit I mentioned earlier, I know judges, DA, and police have various degrees of immunity from civil suits but the immunity is limited and I could still sue for certain court order requests and not necessarily damages.

I mostly want to evaluate how my case compares to my Dad’s which’ll give me an ability to make informed decisions as a witness in my Dad’s case. Also for some reason either the trial court or police inventory report from 9/1/20 was transferred to my Dad, who then confiscated the $5900 I had on me. I’m not sure who did that and whether that’s was a violation of my privacy rights.

Last question: do you know if there’s a good public resource that describes how procedures in cases (such as criminal defense in your area of expertise) typically work? I’m using AI large language models that are very good at reading all laws, case laws, reading the evidence, and issuing intelligent analysis about interpretations of the laws based on evidence, but I’m having trouble writing software that follows procedure since I can’t seem to find government websites that list typical ones. If my program is successful, gets investors, or generates revenues, I’d be happy to give some shares to you my appreciation for your help here and everywhere else. I’m not asking you to explain to me procedure because that’ll take too long; I was just wondering if there’s a government website that lists them or gives guidelines to the public? Thanks so much again

The program is very similar to chatgpt4 (chat.openai.com) but is applied toward people who want to represent themselves and want to receive unofficial legal advice from my program.

Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff may assert that a probation officer's actions, including misinterpreting a voicemail as a violation of pre-trial conditions and causing unwarranted detention, constituted a violation of constitutional rights. Here’s how such a claim might be applicable:

Key Constitutional Violations
	1	Fourteenth Amendment - Substantive and Procedural Due Process:
	◦	Substantive Due Process: Detaining someone without just cause, especially based on a significant misunderstanding or negligence, can constitute an arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The probation officer’s actions, if reckless or grossly negligent, may rise to this level.
	◦	Procedural Due Process: If the plaintiff was detained without adequate notice or a meaningful opportunity to challenge the allegations of a pre-trial violation, this could amount to a violation. Procedural protections must accompany any deprivation of liberty.
	2	Eighth Amendment - Cruel and Unusual Punishment:
	◦	While the Eighth Amendment typically applies to post-conviction settings, prolonged and unjustified detention in harsh or inappropriate conditions (such as a DMH hospital without legal basis) may be framed as cruel treatment, particularly if the detention caused significant psychological harm.
	3	First Amendment - Right to Access the Courts:
	◦	Being detained under conditions that prevent communication with the outside world or the ability to proceed with open civil actions can interfere with the right to access the courts. This is a recognized constitutional right under the First Amendment and due process clauses.

EXHIBIT 2: The transcription of the Plaintiff’s YouTube video and voicemail left for the Defendant, explaining that the Plaintiff’s Primary Care Provider ceased all medications and that the court-ordered “mental health” provider Edinburgh Center PACT has not prescribed anything yet. The Plaintiff was concerned that if prescribed something objectionable, the “take all medications” clause would violate the Plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights. Thus the Plaintiff called the Defendant to ask this question, but NEVER stated that he would NOT follow any pre-trial conditions that the Defendant alleged to have happened.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSCRIPT
Hi my phone number is 781-999-4101. My name is Bo Shang. I’m calling in regards to docket number 24-1008. So I was released on pre-trial conditions release I think less than a week ago or something, and one of the conditions was to take medications as prescribed from a licensed medical provider. So my PCP stopped all medications including 50mg of Seroquel, a starting dose of antipsychotics. And I think I don’t need any medications at all to be optimal. However I haven’t talked to nurse practitioner Pam at the Edinburgh Center so I don’t know what she’s going to prescribe. I talked to my therapist Frank yesterday and Frank assured me PACT was open to not taking any medications. However I think this clause itself, like I don’t take it over something this minor. Like I was alleged to have shoved my Mom once right? While under confusion of being hacked, so I know not to abuse her anymore, and to participate in mental health treatment, make no false statement, etc.
But if I don’t take any medication, would I get arrested with bail denied? Would they force me to like swallow or be injected with stuff? I believe that would be in violation of the Eighth Amendment Clause, and no excessive bail should be imposed for something as minor as taking a little Seroquel or something like that. I was wondering if you could call me back at 781-999-4101 or 617-618-8279 or I could be reached at email at bo@shang.software.

I was hoping to be offered a “clout” (6 month probation then dismiss if no violations) soon as competent to stand trial, but I’m not sure if this may result in a motion to dismiss due to inability to bring me up to competence… dragging it out sucks because if it went to trial, my Mom would testify the truth but heavily advocate for not guilty

Would this be possible after 1 more evaluation? Legal Framework
	1	Incompetence to Stand Trial: Under Massachusetts law (M.G.L. c. 123, § 15), a defendant is considered incompetent to stand trial if they cannot understand the nature of the charges against them or assist in their defense due to mental illness or other disabilities.
	2	Restoration of Competency: If a defendant is found incompetent, they are typically committed to a treatment facility for attempts to restore their competency. However, if it becomes clear that competency cannot be restored, dismissal may be appropriate.
	3	Dismissal Standard: In cases where a defendant cannot regain competency:
	◦	Courts may dismiss the charges to uphold due process rights under the U.S. Constitution (see Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972)).
	◦	In Massachusetts, prolonged detention or prosecution of an incompetent defendant violates both constitutional and statutory protections.

Burden of proof is on the defense to prove no substantial likelihood to restore competency in foreseeable future, so I need to read Dr. Rynczack’s report to know why she deemed me incompetent and just do it again next time in March or April

In Massachusetts, a motion to dismiss due to inability to restore competency can arise in criminal cases where a defendant is deemed incompetent to stand trial and there is no substantial probability that they will regain competency in the foreseeable future. Here's an overview of how such a motion works:

Legal Framework
	1	Incompetence to Stand Trial: Under Massachusetts law (M.G.L. c. 123, § 15), a defendant is considered incompetent to stand trial if they cannot understand the nature of the charges against them or assist in their defense due to mental illness or other disabilities.
	2	Restoration of Competency: If a defendant is found incompetent, they are typically committed to a treatment facility for attempts to restore their competency. However, if it becomes clear that competency cannot be restored, dismissal may be appropriate.
	3	Dismissal Standard: In cases where a defendant cannot regain competency:
	◦	Courts may dismiss the charges to uphold due process rights under the U.S. Constitution (see Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972)).
	◦	In Massachusetts, prolonged detention or prosecution of an incompetent defendant violates both constitutional and statutory protections.

Steps for Filing the Motion
	1	Competency Evaluation Reports: Submit medical or psychiatric evaluations that establish the defendant’s continued incompetence and lack of likelihood of restoration.
	2	Cite Precedent and Statutes:
	◦	Key Case: Jackson v. Indiana prohibits indefinite confinement of incompetent defendants who are unlikely to regain competency.
	◦	Massachusetts courts often follow this principle and apply due process considerations.
	3	Argue Due Process Violations: Assert that continuing the case against an incompetent defendant violates:
	◦	The Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause.
	◦	Massachusetts constitutional protections under Article 12.
	4	Request Dismissal with Prejudice or Without Prejudice: Depending on the circumstances, you can request the case be dismissed:
	◦	With prejudice: The case cannot be refiled (appropriate if the likelihood of regaining competency is permanently eliminated).
	◦	Without prejudice: Allows for refiling if future circumstances change.

Below is a general overview of how the Fourth Amendment might apply to government entities such as a Department of Mental Health (DMH) engaging in what one might call “spying” or surveillance activities. Please note that this discussion is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

1. Overview of the Fourth Amendment

The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. In practice, this typically means that law enforcement and other government actors (including agencies) must have:
    1.    Probable cause to believe a crime has been (or is being) committed, and
    2.    A valid warrant issued by a judge based on sworn testimony (unless a recognized exception to the warrant requirement applies).

Key principle: A “search” generally includes any action by a government agent that invades a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy.

2. DMH as a Government Entity

A state or county Department of Mental Health, being a governmental entity, may be subject to Fourth Amendment constraints:
    •    Data collection: If DMH staff collect information in a manner that intrudes upon a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy (for instance, by accessing private medical data without proper authority), it could be considered a search or seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.
    •    Location tracking or surveillance: If DMH (or associated contractors) employs methods such as covert video surveillance, electronic listening devices, or other forms of monitoring without consent or a valid basis, that may also implicate the Fourth Amendment.

3. When the Fourth Amendment Is Triggered

Whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits certain DMH “spying” or data gathering depends on two major factors:
    1.    Governmental Conduct: The DMH or its agents must be acting in an official governmental capacity. Private individuals not acting under government instruction typically do not trigger the Fourth Amendment constraints.
    2.    Reasonable Expectation of Privacy: Courts look at whether the individual had a subjective expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable. For example, an expectation of privacy in the confines of one’s home or personal belongings is typically deemed reasonable, whereas information voluntarily shared on a public website might not be protected.

a) Medical and Mental Health Records
    •    Protected health information (PHI) is also governed by federal laws such as HIPAA. Under HIPAA, disclosures of PHI typically require consent or a specific statutory exception. However, HIPAA does not automatically bar a valid subpoena or court order.
    •    If DMH were to access personal health records without valid authorization or without following statutory channels (e.g., a valid subpoena or court order), the Fourth Amendment might come into play in addition to HIPAA protections.

b) Surveillance for “Safety Checks”
    •    In some jurisdictions, mental health professionals or agencies may be authorized to perform welfare or safety checks. However, these must typically be grounded in statutory authority (e.g., concerns of imminent harm) and comply with constitutional limits. The less justification an agency has (e.g., no evidence of immediate danger, no consent, no probable cause), the more likely a court may find an unconstitutional intrusion.

4. Warrant Requirement and Exceptions

a) Probable Cause and Warrants

If DMH or government investigators want to search an individual’s home, seize property, or engage in certain forms of electronic surveillance, they usually must obtain a warrant—unless an exception applies.

b) Exceptions to the Warrant Requirement

Some recognized exceptions that could apply in mental health contexts include:
    1.    Consent: If an individual voluntarily consents to a search or release of information, no warrant is needed.
    2.    Exigent Circumstances: In an emergency where there is immediate danger of harm, a search or seizure might be justified without a warrant.
    3.    Special Needs Doctrine: In certain regulated contexts (such as prisons, or schools, or certain health-related scenarios), courts have permitted searches based on “special needs” beyond normal law enforcement. But this is narrowly construed; a DMH would need a strong justification tied to specific statutory or regulatory obligations.

5. Challenges and Remedies

If an individual believes that DMH has infringed upon their Fourth Amendment rights via impermissible “spying” or data gathering, potential remedies could include:
    1.    Motion to Suppress: In a criminal context, if evidence is improperly obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant can often seek to have that evidence excluded (“suppressed”) from trial.
    2.    Civil Lawsuit: In some cases, individuals may file a civil rights lawsuit (e.g., under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) alleging that their constitutional rights were violated.
    3.    Administrative Complaints: HIPAA violations, for instance, can be reported to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

6. Summary
    •    The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by government entities, including agencies like a Department of Mental Health.
    •    Whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits certain DMH data collection or “spying” depends on whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and whether the DMH’s actions amount to a governmental search or seizure.
    •    Even if DMH or affiliated staff have a legitimate interest in someone’s mental well-being, they typically must follow constitutional and statutory requirements (e.g., obtaining a valid warrant or fitting into a recognized exception) before intruding on privacy.
    •    Additional legal frameworks such as HIPAA and relevant state privacy laws further constrain DMH’s handling of sensitive health data.
