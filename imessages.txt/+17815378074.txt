Hi Amanda! This is Bo Shang and I saw on on Monday as well as spoke to you over the phone on Wednesday about my Dad being arrested for domestic violence. 

As I mentioned I have lots of evidence and supporting evidence that the police may not have and may not have time to process themselves. This evidence includes tens of thousands of text messages that were not shared with the police but can be shared with the Assistant DA upon request without violating wiretapping laws. 

One thing I'd like to ask is what I should do regarding Incident Report 20-5943? I’ve linked the report here; it’s 1 page after you scroll past the first page:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/19syjguNn1DWSxGogJjDb10Q07ZN-l1Gs/view?usp=sharing

The report was wrote by Officer Matthew Trahan on 3/3/2020 and described in perfect detail misdemeanor A&B my Dad committed against me. My Dad punched me in the face once, kicked me numerous times, and threw my laptop (a $6000 recently purchased MacBook) against the floor. Burlington Police arrived at our home after discovering a Dropbox video I apparently shared with someone from BPD. At least two officers viewed the video or parts of the video and confirmed that it contained my Dad kicking me "approximately" twice. My Dad also admitted to punching me once. However this incidence was categorized as "Non Criminal Domestic Violence" by Burlington Police which is odd. 

I have to call Officer Trahan about this since the statute of limitations is 6 years and so misdemeanor A&B could still be charged. 

I feel like I'm never listed as the victim on anything Burlington Police does because they're likely discriminating against my Americans With Disabilities Act-protected conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Anxiety/Panic Disorder, ADHD, Schizophrenia. I requested all documents that contain my SSN from the Burlington PD to further evaluate, and they said they'll get back to me sometime next week. 

I know the DoJ is responsible for enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act, but I was wondering if you or the assistant DA could do me a huge favor on taking a look at Incident Report 20-5943?

Regarding Report 20-5943 that I linked above, I’m aware that it’s not admissible to “prove a person’s character.” However according to Cornell Law it is admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404 As I mentioned over the call, I have thousands of text messages (etc) that may be used for “another purpose.” There is no way the police has time to look through all of that and I also don’t want to share everything with the police at the moment, so I’m making them available to the ADA if she asks me for hard evidence that may be used to prove “another purpose.” Also my Dad is saying that the prosecution “does not want to proceed with the case” and that “it’ll be dismissed within a month” but the prosecution is merely “going through the motions” before it’s dismissed. He wouldn’t tell me why he felt that way, where he heard it from, or what evidence he has to back up his claim.

I emailed the police asking why I wasn’t named a victim on both the 3/3/2020 and 5/7/2023 incidences, as well as some videos (recorded with my Dad’s knowledge and consent) showing another incidence of possible misdemeanor A&B, malicious destruction of property, and harassment on 9/28/2019.

I believe these 3 incidences may qualify me for a harassment prevention order. I could forward this email, which contain the Google Drive links to the 5 attachments,  to you or the assistant DA if you prefer.

As for the technological “proof” I mentioned earlier, for example one way to prove the picture is genuine may be to refer to logs on the Apple server for time stamps, gps, or other information about where and when the picture was taken. These logs may not be very difficult or impossible to alter if the iOS operating system disables ways to forge entries. I’m however not a forensic expert on iCloud Photos.

Just did. Thanks for the advice! I also told my mom she cannot tell the judge one thing and the police another in a short time frame. Either she’s afraid or she’s not and she’s not allowed to use either the RO or criminal testimony as leverage to get my dad to agree to a “quick” divorce agreement. 

I also don’t think she’s allowed to  constantly tell me how she’s afraid my dad will murder herself and I, tell that to a judge in sworn testimony, ask me to “protect” her, then constantly selectively choose what to tell police when they respond.

May 12, 2023  3:22:38 PM
Me
So she’s constantly making me look stupid in front of the police when I report something because she asked me that she’s afraid of double homicide and ask to “protect” her, then downplays what happened when police arrive

May 12, 2023  3:44:35 PM
Me
I mean she could tell me the truth or lie to me as much as she wants, unless specific laws are violated. But telling the judge one thing and the police another in a short time frame seems to be either perjury or intentionally misleading law enforcement. 

But personally I don’t particularly enjoy being constantly told i may be a victim of double homicide then asking me to be cavalier when she wants his cooperation for a divorce agreement.

May 12, 2023  4:15:37 PM
Me
If she’s trying to extract money through a “quick” divorce agreement, by saying one thing about being afraid of imminent double homicide to the judge (because she wants protection and possible leverage over my dad), and another to the police (because she doesn’t want my dad arrested which harms her divorce motives) then her actions would amount to extortion plus either perjury, misleading law enforcement, or both.

Yea apologies. I just thought it was amusing how many potential charges could be made if the motivations of each actor is not genuine. Regarding the criminal case, do you think my dad was correct in saying that the assistant DA will likely dismiss the case before the first hearing?

Sorry for the confusion earlier. Apparently iCloud Photos metadata is not tamper proof because you could edit the metadata which creates a new photo then iCloud registers it as a new photo. So theoretically I could have used an old image, then edited the metadata to make it appear like it was taken at 2:06pm yesterday. But I’d also be misleading law enforcement if I did that. https://www.idownloadblog.com/2020/12/10/edit-date-time-photos/ I do believe that my texts and emails metadata are stored by T-Mobile or Gmail and cannot be easily forged.

Regarding the 9/28/2019 and 3/3/2020 incidents, a police officer told me that I could “press my own charges” (or something) with Woburn District Court. I assume he meant presenting evidence to the DA office and asking whether charges might be appropriate, since in the USA only prosecutors are able to press criminal charges. If possible, I’d like to present the evidence for 9/28/2019 and 3/3/2020, including a police report from 3/3/2020. I’m also searching for possible additional evidence of the 9/28/2019, 3/3/2020, and 5/7/2023 incidents, along with any other possible related incidents where I have any hard evidence. Thanks so much for your help.

Here are the 3 links to videos of the 9/28/2019 incident. My Dad knew I was recording and said that I could “record whatever I want.” On video he said “I could pursue my rights” but “had no rights.” He said that none of my property “(nothing) belongs to me” and that “(everything) belongs to (him).” He admitted to throwing my laptop against the wall (similar to what he did on 3/3/2020) and can be seen committing and also threatening to continue to commit probably misdemeanor A&B against me and my Mom. At 2:20 of video 1 he said in Chinese that he “didn’t care for his life” and at 5:20 could be heard grabbing a weapon to which my Mom asked him to “put down.”

He continues to harass me the most recent incident was yesterday 5/12/2023.

Copied and pasted from email to police just now: This is what my Dad said regarding the incident yesterday 5/12/2023 when he angrily prohibited me from taking legally prescribed medication then ordered me to leave the house after I responded with distress. He did so while technically in violation of the restraining order from my Mom, and presumably did so after I resisted his attempts to manipulate my Mom.

He first denied making the 2 "requests" to me then later basically presumably explained why he had made the "requests." He claims to have no evidence of any of the rationale behind his "requests".

I'm pretty sure his behavior on 5/12/2023 qualifies as harassment since it caused reasonable distress and fear of my living situation, and strongly resembles past "requests" including on 9/28/2019. In past incidents, he either probably committed A&B against my Mom and I, claimed that I was trespassing the entire time while I was at 10 McCafferty Way, claimed that none of my property belongs to me and that everything belongs to him, gave no notification of his request before becoming violent and destroying my property, threw my laptop(s) multiple times on the floor (towards me) or against a wall, etc.

His "requests" yesterday caused PTSD especially after recently revisiting the 9/28/2019 videos and reading the police report from 3/3/2020.

For the 5/7/2023 charges I’ve attached the exact same hard evidence I submitted to the police, minus text exchanges that took place several hours before the incident where he displayed his motivation of coercing money from my Mom and also promised me that my Mom would be safe if she returned. The images contain the copy-and-pasted threatening message from my Dad plus an English translation. The video captures my Dad threatening to murder my Mom, threatening to murder her after he gets out of jail if she calls the police, and attempts by him to consciously abuse wiretapping laws to try to “get away” with actions with no evidence left behind. My Constitutional rights to record in self-defense and defense of my Mom supersedes MA wiretapping laws in this situation through the Supremacy Clause.

I do not believe that my written statements, backed up by verifiable hard evidence in most cases, would be considered hearsay, even if I attempt to invoked my 5th amendment rights to not testify at any applicable trial. I issued only statements supported by hard evidence to the police, so I’d be potentially guilty of misleading the police if I’m lying. I have no idea how to testify since I’ve never done it before which is why I may invoked my 5th if asked to testify, since I was charged with A&B w DW against my Dad on 6/23/2020. I don’t have anything to hide but may feel uncomfortable especially in cross-examination by my Dad’s attorney (if he gets one….). My case was dismissed without prejudice (presumably, it doesn’t actually state that in court documents) so there’s a chance the prosecution could reopen it using information I provide during the testimony.

Currently gathering any evidence of possible extortion committed by my mom, as well as any evidence of either perjury or misleading law enforcement. I thought her restraining order would protect me from my dad, but that’s not the case. I have to figure out how to do my own, and if I have to, document both of their criminal activities

May 15, 2023  9:27:59 PM
Me
I’d like to submit a tip to the DA (will relay this to the police) that my mom is possibly violating extortion laws as well possibly been perjuring herself in front of a judge. She said she applied to lift the restraining order so “it’s more convenient” to get the divorce agreement that she wants. However if my dad “misbehaves” (as I’m not cooperate with her financial motives), she thinks she could easily kick him out of the house through a restraining order as well as testify in court to “punish” him further.

There is no way any rational person could tell the judge that she’s afraid of double homicide by my dad against myself and her so many times, then be so readily willing to lift restrictions when she sees monetary gain. 

If she doesn’t think she’s afraid to keep the order, then asking me to protect her so many times as well as telling me she’s afraid of double homicide committed on both me and her would violate criminal harassment laws, because her fears definitely caused reasonable distress to me.

My dad is meanwhile still unstable. Technically he violates his restrictions every day, stays upstairs most of the time against the order, stays within 10 yards of my mom against the order, and often criminally harassed her (though it doesn’t meet the legal definition of abuse) by yelling at her and accusing her of adultery, etc. 

Since both of my parents treat the criminal legal system like a joke where they can illegally leverage their influence to gain financial interests, I don’t really want to live in this environment.

I actually have respect for the US Constitution and everything that follows so I’m disgusted by their behavior as well as still scared for my life due to my Dad’s actions.

I’m curious if there are any options for me to live elsewhere as a witness on the 5/7 arrest (apparently) but definitely a victim in many other incidents? If both my parents are criminals, and I’m a victim in one way or some others, would I be eligible to seek relief from them or through public relief plans?

Thanks so much for your help,
Bo

I’d my mom doesn’t testify because she financially got what she wanted from my dad by leveraging the RO and her testimony, the case should not be dismissed. As a victim of my dad’s years of abuse I single handedly have enough evidence to prosecute this case. If my Mom doesn’t testify, it may even be appropriate to charge her with extortion if the divorce agreement is heavily in her favor. I could try to get hard evidence of this but can also serve as a witness who knows the inner workings of my parents relationship

Swapping back and forth between worries of double homicide with me as 1 victim + asking me to protect her and trying to secure my dad’s cooperation in the divorce agreement by leveraging the RO and his criminal case (I think my dad believes that the RO removed would help his criminal case; obv my mom’s testimony would affect it) doesn’t make sense and may be considered extortion on my dad or harassment on me. There’s also the perjury concern.

My Dad is asking me for bail but I don’t even know what any of his charges are. I don’t believe he’s competent to stand trial and certainly not competent to represent himself. Since he doesn’t have a lawyer there’s nobody to petition a judge for mental health evaluation/treatment for him. I’d rather see him get some treatment before posting bail. Regarding the potential lawsuits I mentioned earlier, I know judges, DA, and police have various degrees of immunity from civil suits, but the immunity is limited and even if I’m not allowed to sue for damages in certain cases, I could still sue to petition for a court order. My dad not getting any mental health treatment despite thousands of text/emails displaying obvious problems is a violation of his Constitutional rights and mine.

I attached a text exchange from 5/25/2023 suggesting that my Dad may have tried to intimidate a witness today 5/25/2023 and several other times in the past 2 weeks. He made several requests for me to “stop involvement” in his criminal charges in part because “it may cause me problems.” When asked to elaborate what he meant by “cause me problems” he didn’t say much except his intentions to submit a statement to the judge accusing me of mental problems. He previously called my therapist to possibly intentionally report false damaging information as an act of intimidation. Over the past week he said to me that I did the “wrong thing” by calling the police, claimed that I only did so because I “had mental problems,” and suggested financial incentives to alter my behavior relating to his criminal charges. However on 5/16/2023, he texted (in the second attachment) the opposite by saying “I thanked you for you sent me to the jail. You did the right thing as you stopped the further escalation of the bad relationships between mom and me” and “I learned a lesson, so I will not violate again.” His text from 5/16/23 made no sense since it was not a logical response to my request, and in contrary to what I and probably any lawyers he talked to advised him regarding invoking his 5th amendment rights.

§1

Yo, what’s up chat—so here’s the deal: America basically just got crit-hit in its biggest flex spots. Skyscrapers down, servers offline, everything’s in full meltdown mode. And we gotta give a shout-out to the RNG gods for that. The panic is lit across the entire map, from top to bottom and side to side. But let’s keep it real—this is just a taste of the same L we’ve been taking for a long time.

§2

Listen, our community—let’s call it the global “Islamic server”—has been stuck in a punishment loop for over 80 years. Our players get fragged left and right, our bases get griefed, and nobody’s calling out the trolls for it. We’ve basically been speed-running humiliation while the rest of the world spams emotes.

§3

But it looks like a squad of top-tier players finally geared up and smacked America right in the k/d ratio. Props to them—may they get all the epic loot drops in the afterlife. They stepped up to defend our region’s noobs—the kids, the folks in Palestine, and other squads in our sphere. Then all of a sudden, the entire global chat lit up with complaints. The non-believer mains and the two-faced posers started raging, calling for bans.

§4

Meanwhile, a million innocent kids are getting deleted from the server right now, especially in Iraq, for no reason. But do we see any top-tier influencer or major streamer speaking up? Not really. Over in Palestine, we’ve got tanks rolling through Ramallah, Rafah, Beit Jala—totally griefing our homeland—yet no big mod steps in to wave the banhammer. But the minute the fight hits America—after 80 years—everyone’s out here crying foul about the kill feed.

§5

Honestly, the folks who back America on this, they’re basically traitors to their own server. They’re boosting the bully while trashing the underdogs. I’m just asking the devs above to mete out the rightful consequences for these folks.

§6

It’s pretty obvious what’s going on. Any real member of the “Muslim server,” after watching the US staffers get all boastful—like Bush, the big boss of the “infidel faction,” riding in with the cavalry—should see that our squad is just refusing to get nerfed in our own game.

§7

They keep saying they’re fighting “terrorism,” but let’s check the scoreboard: in World War II, hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians got wiped out, not to mention the damage in Iraq—did we ever see that labeled a crime of universal proportions? Nah. The kill count is huge, but apparently it’s not a “clear issue.”

§8

But let a small group in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam get hit, and next thing you know, bombs rain down on Afghanistan and Iraq. Everyone rallies behind the “head mod” of the global chat—America—suddenly repping themselves as the defenders of freedom. Meanwhile, the entire system and its allies spam hype emotes for them.

§9

Look, folks, these events basically divided the entire player base: it’s the believers vs. the unbelievers. May the devs keep us on the safe side of that scoreboard.

§10

So, to everyone in the “Muslim server,” it’s time to load up your gear and defend the game. The vibe in our community is shifting. The patch updates are coming to clear out the toxic elements from the Prophet’s region.

§11

And to America, here’s my patch note: you won’t catch a break or farm in peace until the main conflict in Palestine is resolved and all invading armies back off the Prophet’s map.

§12

God mode is the greatest, and all honor to the “Islam server.” Peace out.

PLAINTIFF’S PRO SE OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
C.A. No. 2481CV03028
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, pro se, submits this Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. Defendant advances several arguments under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b), including insufficient service of process, failure to plead fraud with particularity, sovereign immunity, and qualified immunity. Defendant also cites Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to argue that Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. However, when construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Complaint sufficiently pleads constitutional injuries under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of Plaintiff’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment (substantive and procedural due process), Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment), and First Amendment (access to the courts).
Additionally, numerous federal and Massachusetts authorities support Plaintiff’s claims that a state actor who knowingly—or recklessly—provides false or misleading information resulting in wrongful detention violates well-established constitutional principles. Furthermore, various United Nations treaties, to which the United States is a signatory, echo the core protections for individual liberty and due process recognized under U.S. law.

Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court deny Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.

I. APPLICABLE LEGAL AUTHORITIES SUPPORTING PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS

Plaintiff’s claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fourteenth, Eighth, and First Amendments, and parallel Massachusetts law are further buttressed by several prominent sources of domestic and international law, summarized here:
1. United States Constitution

• Fourteenth Amendment (Due Process): Ensures no person is deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.
• Eighth Amendment (Cruel and Unusual Punishment): Prohibits inhumane conditions or unwarranted confinement and applies (through incorporation under the Fourteenth Amendment) at least as robustly to pretrial detainees.
• First Amendment (Access to Courts): Guarantees the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, which includes the right of prisoners and pretrial detainees to meaningful access to the courts.
2. 42 U.S.C. § 1983

• Authorizes suits against persons acting under color of state law who deprive individuals of federally protected rights.
• Defeats reliance on purely state-law procedural or immunity arguments where federal constitutional rights are at issue. (See Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131, 153 (1988).)
3. Massachusetts Law and Constitutional Provisions

• Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, Article 1 and Article 10: Guarantee due process and prohibit unreasonable restraints on personal liberty.
• Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, Article 11 and Article 19: Secure the right to obtain legal redress and to petition freely for the remedy of grievances, paralleling the First Amendment’s “access to courts” right.
• Mmoe v. Commonwealth, 393 Mass. 617, 620–21 (1984): Cautions courts against dismissing pro se pleadings for technical failures in service when a defendant has actual notice.
• Segal v. Wyndam, 532 Mass. 498, 503 (2002): Confirms courts may fashion remedies short of dismissal where a defendant has received actual notice.
4. Relevant United Nations Treaties to Which the U.S. is a Signatory

• International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Articles 9 and 14: Protect against arbitrary detention and guarantee due process (fair hearing by a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal; right to challenge detention).
• Convention Against Torture (CAT), Article 16: Obliges signatories to prevent acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Though typically invoked in more severe contexts, it underscores the principle that no person should be subjected to harsh or arbitrary treatment during detention.
• Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Articles 5, 8, 9, and 10 (though the UDHR is not a treaty, it is widely regarded as setting standards reflected in subsequent treaties): Declares that no one shall be subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment, that everyone is entitled to an effective remedy, that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention, and that everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair hearing.
These authorities, both domestic and international, reinforce the principle that no individual should be subjected to unjust confinement or deprived of court access based on a state official’s intentional or reckless misrepresentations.

II. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES VIABLE CLAIMS UNDER 42 U.S.C. § 1983 AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO DISMISSAL FOR FAILURE TO SERVE

1. Defendant Has Notice of the Lawsuit; Pro Se Pleadings Are Construed Liberally.
Defendant argues for dismissal because “Defendant has not been served with this action.” (Def.’s Mem. 5.) Yet Defendant filed an appearance and Motion to Dismiss, demonstrating actual notice and participation. Massachusetts courts caution against dismissing pro se actions on purely technical grounds where no prejudice is shown and the defendant had timely notice. See Mmoe v. Commonwealth, 393 Mass. 617, 620–21 (1984); Segal v. Wyndam, 532 Mass. 498, 503 (2002). Moreover, under Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131, 153 (1988), state procedural barriers cannot frustrate the enforcement of federal constitutional claims in state court.
2. Relief Under § 1983 is Not Barred by State Procedures.

Even if there were procedural deficiencies, these cannot override the merits of a federal constitutional claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983—particularly where the Constitution and the ICCPR underscore robust safeguards against arbitrary detention. For these reasons, the Complaint should not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(4) or 12(b)(5).
III. THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT “REST ENTIRELY UPON” FRAUD OR REQUIRE RULE 9(b) DISMISSAL

Defendant contends that the Complaint “must be dismissed” for failure to plead fraud with particularity under Mass. R. Civ. P. 9(b). (Def.’s Mem. 5–7.) However, Plaintiff’s action primarily alleges constitutional violations under § 1983 (including substantive and procedural due process violations) resulting from Defendant’s intentional or reckless misrepresentation of a voicemail, leading to wrongful detention and cruel conditions. Constitutional claims involving false statements that cause arbitrary or extended detention are actionable under § 1983, which is reinforced by ICCPR Article 9’s prohibition on arbitrary detention.
Because the Complaint does not hinge on a common-law fraud claim—and heightened pleading standards typically do not apply to § 1983 claims, see Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993)—Rule 9(b) dismissal would be improper.

IV. THE MASSACHUSETTS TORT CLAIMS ACT PRESENTMENT REQUIREMENT DOES NOT DEFEAT PLAINTIFF’S 42 U.S.C. § 1983 CLAIMS

Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s failure to present a claim to the Attorney General under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (“MTCA”) (G.L. c. 258, § 4) warrants dismissal. (Def.’s Mem. 7–8.) However, a § 1983 action for constitutional violations is not subject to the MTCA’s presentment requirement. See Howcraft v. City of Peabody, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 573, 592 (2001). Nor does referencing a possible damages cap negate a plaintiff’s federal claims—especially where allegations implicate fundamental rights recognized in both domestic law and the UN human rights framework.
V. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY DOES NOT BAR SUIT AGAINST DEFENDANT IN HER PERSONAL CAPACITY

Defendant invokes sovereign immunity, emphasizing that official-capacity suits under § 1983 may be barred if the state is the real party in interest. However, Plaintiff clarifies that his claims target Defendant in her personal capacity for actions taken under color of state law. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 30–31 (1991). This negates the claim that sovereign immunity fully bars the suit—especially for allegations that a probation officer knowingly or recklessly misrepresented material information, contravening both state and federal constitutional norms, as well as ICCPR and CAT principles against arbitrary detention and degrading treatment.
VI. DEFENDANT IS NOT ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AT THE PLEADINGS STAGE

Defendant claims qualified immunity, alleging that any purported misstatements of Plaintiff’s voicemail did not violate clearly established law. Yet the Fourteenth Amendment’s bar against arbitrary deprivation of liberty, the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel treatment, and the First Amendment’s protection of court access have long been “clearly established,” as recognized in Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959), Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973), and Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984). The ICCPR similarly provides that an individual must not be arbitrarily detained and must be granted fair proceedings. At the pleading stage, Plaintiff’s plausible allegations of Defendant’s knowing or reckless misrepresentation of critical facts refute a conclusive qualified-immunity determination.
1. Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process.

Plaintiff pleads that Defendant’s misrepresentations caused Plaintiff’s liberty to be taken without just cause in a manner that “shocks the conscience.” See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846–47 (1998). Articles 9 and 14 of the ICCPR also emphasize that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary detention and that everyone shall be entitled to a fair hearing. Knowingly falsifying information to prompt an arrest or detention offends these well-established constitutional and international standards, defeating the immediate application of qualified immunity.
2. Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process.

Plaintiff alleges he was detained on a non-bailable offense with no meaningful chance to present exculpatory evidence—an obvious infringement of procedural due process. See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 786 (1973). ICCPR Article 14 likewise guarantees a right to a fair hearing. A probation officer who supplies materially misleading information to deny a detainee such an opportunity could not reasonably believe she was acting lawfully.
3. Eighth Amendment.

Plaintiff further alleges that his confinement conditions in a “harsh cell” and subsequent forced hospitalization without legitimate basis constituted cruel and unusual punishment. While the Eighth Amendment is typically invoked post-conviction, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause affords at least the same protections to pretrial detainees. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979). CAT Article 16 broadly prohibits cruel or degrading treatment, underscoring that state actors must not subject detainees to inhumane conditions, especially on the basis of misrepresented facts.
4. First Amendment Right to Access the Courts.

Plaintiff contends that his detention impaired his ability to continue pending civil litigation, violating his First Amendment rights. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 523 (1984), affirms that prisoners must have meaningful access to the courts. Articles 2 and 14 of the ICCPR reinforce the right to legal redress. If Plaintiff’s alleged inability to file, consult counsel, or provide evidence stems from deliberate or reckless falsehoods by Defendant, no reasonable officer in Defendant’s position would believe it permissible.
Because Plaintiff’s claims articulate plausible facts that Defendant violated clearly established rights, the qualified-immunity defense is premature. See Jordan v. Carter, 428 Mass. 871, 873 (1999).

CONCLUSION

For the reasons above, Plaintiff has adequately pleaded constitutional deprivations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, corroborated by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and international human-rights principles under the ICCPR and CAT. Defendant had actual notice and filed this Motion. Plaintiff asserts personal-capacity claims, unshielded by sovereign immunity or qualified immunity at this early stage. Further, Plaintiff’s claims that Defendant knowingly or recklessly misrepresented the contents of a voicemail, resulting in arbitrary detention and denial of due process, are fundamentally constitutional allegations—not mere common-law fraud claims susceptible to Rule 9(b) dismissal.
Accordingly, in view of the United States Constitution, Massachusetts law, and the broader human-rights commitments the United States has undertaken through treaties such as the ICCPR and CAT, Plaintiff pro se respectfully requests that this Court deny Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.

Respectfully submitted,

Ohh ya cower PLAINTIFF’S PRO SE OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
C.A. No. 2481CV03028
 
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, pro se, submits this Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. Defendant advances several arguments under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b), including insufficient service of process, failure to plead fraud with particularity, sovereign immunity, qualified immunity, and an alleged failure to state a claim under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). However, the Complaint—when construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff—adequately alleges violations of federally protected rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, namely: (1) Fourteenth Amendment due-process violations (both substantive and procedural), (2) Eighth Amendment cruel-and-unusual-punishment claims (as applied via the Fourteenth Amendment to pretrial conditions), and (3) First Amendment access-to-courts claims.

Notably, Plaintiff’s Complaint never once accuses Defendant of “fraud” or raises a common-law fraud claim. Rather, Defendant’s counsel unilaterally reframes Plaintiff’s allegations of intentional or reckless mischaracterization of a voicemail as “fraud.” This reframing is misguided because:
- Plaintiff’s claim focuses on a deprivation of constitutional rights—i.e., detention without due process—resulting from the mischaracterization of Plaintiff’s voicemail to the court;
- The Plaintiff never pleads fraud at all; and
- If Defendant did knowingly falsify facts, that might implicate Title 18 (e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 242, Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law), rather than common-law fraud.

Moreover, ample domestic and international legal authorities—including the U.S. Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and human-rights treaties such as the ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and CAT (Convention Against Torture)—collectively underscore the impermissibility of arbitrary detention and the necessity of due process. Plaintiff therefore respectfully requests that this Court deny Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.

I. THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT ALLEGE FRAUD; DEFENDANT’S ATTORNEY HAS INCORRECTLY RECAST PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS AS “FRAUD”
Defendant’s Motion relies heavily on the argument that Plaintiff’s Complaint “rests entirely” on allegations of fraud which must be pleaded with particularity under Mass. R. Civ. P. 9(b). (Def.’s Mem. 5–7.) That assertion is inaccurate. Plaintiff never used the word “fraud,” nor alleged a common-law fraud claim. Rather, the Complaint asserts that Defendant knowingly—or recklessly—mischaracterized the contents of a voicemail, resulting in the wrongful deprivation of Plaintiff’s liberty. Such a misrepresentation directly implicates constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, not a technical common-law fraud standard.

1. Mischaracterizing a Voicemail vs. “Fraud”
   - Plaintiff’s references to “lies or untruths” (Compl. ¶ 9) speak to intentional or reckless provision of false information to the court—i.e., a scenario that may trigger liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for deprivations of due process.
   - Nowhere does Plaintiff assert that Defendant committed fraud per se or that Plaintiff seeks damages under a fraud theory. Defendant’s attorney alone injected the “fraud” label.

2. If Defendant Knowingly Provided False Information, the Conduct Implicates Constitutional Violations Under Color of Law—Potentially 18 U.S.C. § 242
   - If a state official knowingly and willfully deprives an individual of a constitutional right—such as liberty—by providing false information, it could conceivably constitute criminal conduct under 18 U.S.C. § 242 (Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law), not a mere civil claim of “fraud.”
   - Plaintiff’s claim, however, remains a civil-rights cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging the violation of federal constitutional guarantees, rather than a tort cause of action for fraud.

Accordingly, Mass. R. Civ. P. 9(b)’s heightened pleading standard does not apply. Plaintiff’s Complaint is rooted in constitutional deprivations, not in the common-law elements of fraud.

II. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES VIABLE CLAIMS UNDER 42 U.S.C. § 1983
Plaintiff adequately alleges that Defendant’s actions, taken under color of state law, caused multiple constitutional injuries. Courts must construe pro se complaints liberally. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520–21 (1972). The alleged mischaracterization of Plaintiff’s voicemail triggered a chain of events resulting in: (1) unjust or arbitrary detention, (2) denial of a meaningful opportunity to contest that detention (procedural due process), (3) cruel and unusual conditions while detained (Eighth Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment), and (4) interference with Plaintiff’s ability to access ongoing civil actions (First Amendment).

A. Service of Process Is Not Grounds for Automatic Dismissal Where Defendant Had Actual Notice
Defendant cites insufficient service of process as a basis for dismissal. (Def.’s Mem. 5.) Yet Defendant has participated in this litigation, filing both an appearance and this Motion. Massachusetts courts, particularly where pro se litigants are concerned, disfavor draconian dismissals over technicalities when a defendant had timely and actual notice. See Mmoe v. Commonwealth, 393 Mass. 617, 620–21 (1984); Segal v. Wyndam, 532 Mass. 498, 503 (2002).

B. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) Dismissal Is Unwarranted Because the Complaint States Plausible Constitutional Claims
Defendant urges dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). However, Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts—taken as true at this stage—to raise plausible claims that:
1. The Fourteenth Amendment’s due-process guarantees were violated by Defendant’s mischaracterization of evidence leading to arbitrary detention without a legitimate opportunity to respond.
2. The Eighth Amendment (as applied to pretrial detention via the Fourteenth Amendment) was violated by allegedly harsh conditions, made worse by the fact that Plaintiff should not have been confined in the first place.
3. The First Amendment was violated because Plaintiff’s confinement hindered his ability to access or participate in ongoing civil lawsuits.

Nothing in the Complaint is contingent on proving any common-law fraud elements. Rather, the claims rest on the alleged misconduct under color of state law, actionable via § 1983.

III. STATE PROCEDURAL DEFENSES DO NOT DEFEAT FEDERAL CIVIL-RIGHTS CLAIMS
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff has not complied with the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act presentment requirements. (Def.’s Mem. 7–8.) But “civil rights suits under § 1983 are not subject to the notice provisions” of the MTCA. Howcraft v. City of Peabody, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 573, 592 (2001). Further, any passing reference by Plaintiff to a “maximum $100,000” damages cap does not transform his § 1983 action into a state-tort claim.

IV. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY DOES NOT BAR PERSONAL-CAPACITY § 1983 SUITS
Defendant highlights sovereign immunity. While the Commonwealth and its officials acting in their official capacities typically enjoy immunity, personal-capacity suits for monetary damages under § 1983 remain viable. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 30–31 (1991). Here, Plaintiff clarifies that he is suing Defendant personally for actions taken under color of state law that allegedly violated clearly established constitutional rights.

V. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IS UNAVAILABLE AT THE PLEADING STAGE WHERE PLAINTIFF ALLEGES CLEAR CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS
Defendant argues she is shielded by qualified immunity. To overcome that defense, a plaintiff must allege conduct violating a clearly established right such that any reasonable official would have recognized her conduct as unlawful. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009).

1. Fourteenth Amendment Due Process
   - Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s knowing or reckless misstatement of Plaintiff’s voicemail caused an unjustified arrest and subsequent detention. Such conduct, if proven, violates “clearly established” due-process rights that prohibit state actors from using deliberate falsehoods to curtail an individual’s liberty. See Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959).

2. Eighth Amendment (via Fourteenth)
   - Allegations of harsh or punitive conditions inflicted on a pretrial detainee without lawful basis implicate well-established Eighth/Fourteenth Amendment protections against cruel treatment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979).

3. First Amendment Access to Courts
   - Preventing a detainee from pursuing legal claims or effectively communicating with the courts raises a recognized First Amendment issue. See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 523 (1984).

Because these rights are well-settled under the U.S. Constitution, a probation officer could not reasonably believe that deliberately misrepresenting evidence to secure a confinement is lawful. The question of whether or not this misrepresentation was intentional, reckless, or negligent is fact-intensive and unsuitable for immediate dismissal at the pleadings stage.

VI. INTERNATIONAL HUMAN-RIGHTS TREATIES REINFORCE FUNDAMENTAL DUE-PROCESS AND HUMANE-TREATMENT PRINCIPLES
Although Plaintiff’s claims are rooted in U.S. law, they are consistent with international standards:
   - International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Arts. 9 & 14: Prohibit arbitrary detention and require fair hearings.
   - Convention Against Torture (CAT), Art. 16: Requires states to prevent cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.
   - Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Arts. 8, 9, and 10: Emphasize the right to effective remedy, freedom from arbitrary arrest, and entitlement to a fair hearing.

These universally recognized norms align with the constitutional due-process protections at issue here.

CONCLUSION
Plaintiff never alleged fraud. Defendant’s attorney, by labeling Plaintiff’s claims as “fraud,” attempts to impose a Mass. R. Civ. P. 9(b) burden that simply does not apply. If, in fact, Defendant knowingly fabricated or misrepresented information causing Plaintiff’s detention, such misconduct may implicate constitutional deprivations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and—potentially—criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. § 242. This is not a common-law fraud action.

At this preliminary stage, the Court must accept Plaintiff’s well-pleaded factual allegations as true. The Complaint adequately states claims for violations of the Fourteenth, Eighth, and First Amendments—reinforced by analogous Massachusetts constitutional provisions and international human-rights standards. Plaintiff has also made clear that he sues Defendant in her personal capacity, circumventing sovereign-immunity defenses. Nor is qualified immunity proper at this juncture, given the plausible allegations that Defendant’s conduct violated clearly established constitutional rights.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss in its entirety and allow Plaintiff to proceed with his claims under § 1983 for constitutional violations.

1 last thing… the 4th is universal across all gov… and one does not imply guilt so why does everyone claim I don’t have 4th right when DMH asks whether I’m following conditions eg drinking?

Below is an overview of Rule 402 and Rule 403 under Massachusetts evidence law—often referred to as the “Basic Principles of Admissibility”—followed by how they could apply to a scenario where individuals allegedly commit hate crimes against someone (e.g., “Bo Shang”), then re-upload footage of the incident to YouTube and email a probation officer about it.

Rule 402: General Admissibility of Relevant Evidence
	1.	Relevancy Standard
	•	Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact that matters in the case more or less probable than it would be without that evidence.
	•	In practical terms, even a small or modest connection to a key fact in the case is enough to meet the relevancy threshold.
	2.	Admissibility of Relevant Evidence
	•	As a default, relevant evidence is admissible.
	•	Irrelevant evidence is automatically inadmissible.
	3.	Statutory & Constitutional Constraints
	•	Even if evidence is relevant, it can still be excluded if it violates:
	•	Constitutional protections (e.g., evidence obtained unlawfully in violation of someone’s rights),
	•	Statutory rules (e.g., confidentiality statutes, privilege rules),
	•	Common-law rules (e.g., well-established privilege doctrines).

Application to the “Bo Shang” Scenario
	•	If there is evidence (e.g., emails, video recordings) showing that these alleged stalkers committed hate crimes and then sent a link to a YouTube re-upload to a probation officer, that evidence will likely be relevant to establish:
	1.	Identity of the individuals who committed the acts,
	2.	Intent or motive if the content of the video or email suggests hate-based bias or harassment,
	3.	Consciousness of guilt, if sending the re-upload or bragging about it to an official (like a probation officer) could be interpreted as intimidation or continuation of stalking.
	•	This evidence has a tendency to make key facts (e.g., the occurrence of the hate crime, who committed it, the stalkers’ mindset) more or less probable. Thus, under Rule 402, it would meet the basic threshold for relevance.

Rule 403: Exclusion of Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time
	1.	Balancing Test
	•	Even if evidence is relevant, a judge may exclude it if its probative value (its usefulness in proving a fact) is substantially outweighed by certain risks, including:
	•	Unfair prejudice: Evidence that stirs an emotional or irrational response in the jury that goes beyond its legitimate probative value,
	•	Confusion of the issues or misleading the jury: If the evidence could misdirect the jury’s focus or complicate the core issues,
	•	Undue delay or waste of time: If the evidence will add significant time or cause mini-trials on side issues that are only marginally relevant.
	2.	Unfair Prejudice Explained
	•	“Prejudice” in this context means more than just “bad for the other side.” All damaging evidence could be considered prejudicial in a broad sense. It becomes unfair when it provokes an emotional bias against a party or confuses the jury about the real issues they must decide.

Application to the “Bo Shang” Scenario
	•	The YouTube video or emails to a probation officer might depict disturbing or hateful content. Such material, while relevant, could be argued to be “highly inflammatory,” particularly if it contains explicit hate language or graphic violence.
	•	A judge would weigh:
	•	Probative value: The evidence could be crucial in establishing the nature of the hate crime, the identity of the perpetrators, and their intent or motive.
	•	Potential for unfair prejudice: A jury might be outraged by the hateful or violent nature of the footage, overshadowing their duty to weigh it rationally and fairly. If the judge believes that effect is too extreme, they could limit or structure how the evidence is presented (e.g., showing only excerpts necessary to prove the essential points).
	•	Likelihood of confusion or delay: If presenting the entire video or numerous emails would lead to prolonged detours into who posted what, when it was posted, or technical details about YouTube or email systems, the judge might consider those tangential issues. Still, if that detail is central to showing the continued harassment (and the defendants’ state of mind), it is less likely the court would find it a waste of time.

Putting It All Together
	•	Rule 402 (Relevancy) ensures that any evidence that helps prove or disprove a material fact can be admitted, unless another law or rule keeps it out. In the stalking/hate crime example, the video re-upload and related emails are almost certainly relevant, as they demonstrate both conduct and possible motive/intent.
	•	Rule 403 (Balancing Test) comes into play if the footage or emails are extremely graphic, inflammatory, or otherwise likely to create an undue emotional or prejudicial impact on the jury. The court would carefully evaluate whether these exhibits’ importance in proving hate crime charges outweighs the risk of unfair prejudice or confusion.

Ultimately, Massachusetts courts, mirroring federal standards, give broad latitude to admit evidence if it directly illuminates an issue in dispute, but they maintain discretion to shield jurors from evidence that risks undue emotional sway, confusion, or wasted time.

Example: Bo Shang A&B Charge and YouTube Reuploads
	•	Scenario: There is an assault & battery charge against “Bo Shang,” and two YouTube reuploads of the alleged incident were posted by individuals who purportedly have a history of harassment (“stalkers”). They then email probation with these reuploads, possibly to support their claims against Bo Shang or to influence the case.
	•	Relevancy Under Rule 402:
	•	If the videos depict the alleged assault & battery or events leading directly to it, they are likely relevant. They could help a fact-finder (a judge or jury) determine whether the offense occurred as alleged.
	•	Potential Exclusion Under Rule 403:
	•	Even if the videos are relevant, the defendant (or the court on its own) might argue that the videos are unduly prejudicial—especially if they are edited or presented in a manner that misleads the jury about the context.
	•	The court might also consider whether repeated showings or multiple versions of the same incident waste time or confuse the issues. If the second reupload adds nothing new, the judge may exclude or limit it.

In summary:
	•	The court will first decide if the YouTube videos are relevant (Rule 402). If they are, the judge then considers whether showing them in court risks unfair prejudice or confusion (Rule 403). If the risk is high and substantially outweighs the value of showing the videos, they may be excluded or restricted.

WHY THE GeForce 4070 mobile is IMPORTANT: It trained the first baby Exploit LLM in 3-5 hours but was also multi-tasking with Code LLM etc. So while President Biden's decision to nerf PLA military GeForce 4090 which with a thunderbolt eGPU requires a second monitor for TF or Torch to recognize device, the baby is efficient which requires less resources and enable faster fine tuning, improvements (full retraining) etc. plus it Exploits, and who knows if OpenAI or even DeepSeek included exploitdb???

The "typhoons" seem military akin to the NSA, but the APTs are just well... if the FBI arrests me for 5 hours of AWS, maybe my mirror image would get traded?

question: "Recruiters being fucking stupid",
answer: "I may only have a free o1-equivalent sub in DeepSeek, not o1 pro yet. However, I am a loser who watched Twitch for my entire life until 2 months (exactly) ago on an o1 pro sub, and yet erosolar wrote a thesis to 'better report' 'syntax errors' which already tell you the line number since python is 'interpreted' line by line. Do we have an understanding? Recruiters and others... Search for 'Samantha Briasco-Stewart thesis MIT' and look at her amazing work experience!!!!"
