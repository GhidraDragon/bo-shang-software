Dear Apple Support,

I purchased an iPhone 14 in the US but I’m traveling in China right now to attend a funeral. Can I use the US version of the Apple Store app to create reservations for AppleCare appointments or buy new products at Chinese Apple Stores?

Yes I was just wondering if AppleCare+ for my Mac is valid internationally and also wondering if I could use the same app internationally to manage appointments at the Apple Store and buy things

It says to change my region I shouldn’t have any money on my Apple Card and that I’d need a new local payment method

Representative Greene could you help me with exposing myself on Twitch?

Dear Representative Greene,

I unfortunately watched Twitch and read Pokimane's "undying love and appreciation" "contract" then believed in it enough. Later I thought it was a good idea to attempt to impress her by masterbating while pointing a camera at my wiener then upload it to Pornhub. I have several thousand views now https://www.pornhub.com/video/search?search=pokimane

I heard that 18 U.S. Code § 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television made it criminally illegal for anyone in the United States to devise or intend to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud (https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-1034014607-980273003&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:63:section:1343), or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme.

I was wondering if you could help?

Sincerely,
Davenport Knights

PS I was wondering if you knew what your social media may have in common with Osama Bin Laden’s 2002 Letter addressed to Americans? Well roughly half of your tweets are hateful propaganda that may confuse people and lead to real violence. Bin Laden also wrote something similar but that he had the right to seek revenge against his murderer. In the United States, the Second Amendment “guarantees” (lol) that a “well regulated Militia, being nece
ssary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Do you notice some logic between your tweets and Bin Laden’s 2002 letter?

Just to re confirm are you stating that there is a physical damage on your iPhone for which you are looking to claim the AppleCare coverage?

Probably depending on what counts as normal wear and tear or functional damage 🥲 I mean even IP68 might break its ratings due to accidental damage for some reason 🥲

No problem, we can help you with that. To screen remotely screen share, we would need to get in touch with our phone support team since only they have the tools for this. If you think this would make the troubleshooting easier, I can schedule a call back for you.

Okie doke!  Sometimes with the reinstalls, we might see a blank screen, Apple logo, or a progress bar periodically during the process.  Usually that page will change, at least within the hour, but if it seems to stay on that Apple for a full hour, and didn't flip over to a progress bar, go blank, or anything different it may be safe to say it's not progressing.  I think we might be right around the 30 minute mark.

I may recommend to try leaving it about another 15-25 minutes more, and if it hasn't changed screens, we can power off the Mac and reboot it into recovery mode once more.  Did you use recovery mode to erase it earlier also?

Great! You are definitely on the right track there!  After a little more time has gone, you can try that one more time, I would actually try running first aid on your disk first:  

https://support.apple.com/102611  It'll also be in disk utility   but just run first aid on the last drive/volume and up to the first one. Then erase it the same way in the erase guide, or reply here and I can show you how to do that also! Then we'll run that reinstall one more time!

If a set of AirPods, a Find My network accessory or compatible Bluetooth location-tracking device is detected but the Find My app has issues connecting to them or to the server at that time, this alert will be displayed: Unknown Accessory Detected. This alert will only be displayed if a set of AirPods, a Find My network accessory or compatible Bluetooth location-tracking device is detected near you, not an AirTag. These could be borrowed AirPods, or AirPods inadvertently left behind by a friend or family member.


So its for your security reasons only that if any AirTag is near you you are informed about it so that no one is able to track you 

And I understand its your AirTag only but it possible that if its connected to any other device you can get the notifications

No reset it not needed, you need to disconnect the affected airtag the re-add it to your Apple ID and device 

It can be removed from find my by going to http://iCloud.com/find or settings > Apple ID > find my

Thank you for sharing your concern. I can understand how inconvenient this has been for you.

urn:biz:b15ed773-9eed-11e7-baa2-7b88b04daa8e
Here's how to reset your AirTag:


	1	Press down on the polished stainless steel battery cover of your AirTag and rotate anticlockwise until the cover stops rotating.

	2	Remove the cover and the battery.*

	3	Replace the battery.

	4	Press down on the battery until you hear a sound. This sound means that the battery is connected. 

	5	When the sound finishes, repeat the process four more times, removing and replacing the battery, then pressing down on the battery until you hear a sound. 

You should hear a sound each time you press on the battery, for a total of five sounds. 

The fifth sound is different from the previous four. This indicates that the AirTag is now ready to pair.


	6	Replace the cover by aligning the three tabs on the cover with the three slots on your AirTag.


	7	Press down on the cover.


	8	Rotate the cover clockwise until it stops rotating.

Common this should be easy; can you have enough faith in Apple to tell a local customer who’s spent however much, plus anyone who reads my press eventually, that Apple does not pre-install or software update software that could secretly spy & control anything from user of ur products not human rights destruction products of your user

Common easy yes right? Apple would never harm intentionally from the start? Obv I prefer human rights violations via software update but sometimes I dunno easier to pre-install in Apple Builds
