Dear Dr Yang,

A helpful person from your staff just called to help me set up an appointment, but apparently I needed to switch my Masshealth to Fallon Atrius first, which I just did. Fallon told me it will take 1-2 days for their system to update and then Iâ€™ll be able to schedule an appointment.

Thanks so much again and best regards,
Bo
