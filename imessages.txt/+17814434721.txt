Hi Ramona. If the Vyvanse doesn’t arrive today, I’m pretty sure it got declined by the insurance. I think the doctor called and checked that the medication would be free if the insurance covered it, but from my experience the insurance usually declines these expensive medications. If it doesn’t arrive, could you please call the pharmacy and tell them I’ll pay out of pocket if necessary? The maximum I’d be willing to pay is $250 for the 2 week supply. Thanks!

Hi Bo - the Vyvanse was delivered a few minutes ago. I talked to Alicia, who’s our new PACT nurse and she’ll verify the order tomorrow morning and call you to establish a good time for her to stop by and drop off one week worth of the Vyvanse. I’ll be out of the office tomorrow but Alicia will get in touch with you tomorrow morning.

Hi Ramona,

I just want to confirm that PACT allows patients to schedule what I termed a consultation but the apparently correct term was “second opinions” without “establishing me as a patient” with other doctors? These were the exact words another doctor used when I informed him that I did not want to leave PACT but rather obtain second or third opinions on my medical treatment without establishing me as a patient or having any medication prescribed.

Thanks so much,
Bo

Hi Bo, I would like to reiterate that PACT does not recommend reaching out to an outpatient psychiatrist as that does not meet the quality continuation of care the program is aiming towards.

Hi Ramona,

Thanks for clarifying. I apparently didn’t understand what you were trying to convey over the phone earlier.

I was wondering what you meant by an “outpatient” psychiatrist? Am I considered an “inpatient” at PACT? I’m obviously not staying in a hospital while being treated by PACT.

https://www.ecrmc.org/for-patients/inpatient-vs-outpatient-hospital-status/

Also I was wondering why PACT believes a “second opinion” when shared with the treatment physician and others at PACT would adversely affect the “quality continuation of care?”

I’m not sure if this is part of of your job, but I'd like to submit a voluntary "medication count check" to prove I have been taking the medication exactly as prescribed. I'd be willing to voluntarily submit to weekly or daily checks in the future, or ask my mother to do so for additional verification, to prove I am in 100% compliance with PACT's treatment plan. I would appreciate it if you could include this information in my medical records.

This information may be helpful for PACT physicians to know because while the 70mg of Vyvanse is extremely helpful in getting study/work/personal health done, I still have strong evidence which people who interact with me can confirm that I cannot focus nearly as well as peers with similar standardized/IQ testing results and education levels, and that ADHD still presents a strong deficiency despite the medication. I know medication can't solve every deficiency but I have been prescribed much more Vyvanse, Adderall, or Dexedrine in the past at MGH, Commonwealth Psychology and another PCP practice I cannot remember the name of.

Sorry for so many texts and thanks so much

By “much more” I meant “A 30 mg dose of Vyvanse is equal (https://www.uacap.org/uploads/3/2/5/0/3250432/stimulant_equivalency.pdf)

Hi Ramona,

Frank met with me and thought it was a good idea for my mom to text him once a week include a daily “medication verification check” she’s agreed to perform as well as a brief statement of how I’m doing.

He also answered my question concerning whether I was considered an “inpatient” which he clarified I wasn’t and that a “second opinion” is fine. I’ve texted him the messages I sent to the other doctor as well as his response.

The only request I have for you is to make sure Dr Harrison’s prescription is ready for me to pick up on 4/6 when I get back. The current 14 day supply is scheduled to run out after 4/3 as it was filled on 3/21.

Sorry for sending the same request to multiple people at PACT and thanks again for helping me all these months.

Could I pick it up at closing time if it gets delivered before then? I get up at 6-7 and have a need to be productive shortly after.

If the medication can be reliably delivered weekly with 1 extra dose for the morning of the day of the new delivery I’d prefer that since it reduces the risk from losing medication.

Ok great I’ll see you at 10. Do you know how long dr Harrison’s prescription was for?

Apr 07, 2023  9:55:25 AM
Me
Also can you verify with the new prescriber that she shares in Dr Harrison’s views of not objecting to me “saving” a dose on occasional days when Im not able to spend much time on professional or important activities? These “medication breaks” not only allow me to save a dose but also reduces dependency by giving me practice in how to perform as well as possible without meds. 

Dr Harrison’s view was shared by numerous previous prescribing doctors including Dr Tolga Ceranoglu and Dr Craig Surman of MGH, who are both Harvard Medical School professors specializing in ASD and ADHD. 

On high stakes days I take 2 doses which noticeably increases my reading comprehension, writing, and problem solving skills with no perceptible side effects. There’s no signs of withdrawal on days I don’t take it. 

This is relevant because technically according to the doctor’s prescription I should be able to have them filled as soon as pharmacies allow it. Also many doctors prescribe a 30 day supply every 28 days to allow patients better flexibility in when to use their deficiency-reducing medication.

The part of my medical record in Edinburgh center from before I started at Edinburgh is incredibly inaccurate and totally falsified in many ways. That part was likely copy and pasted from a summary Dr Leonard Lai from Tewksbury wrote. I can provide Edinburgh with electronic access to my MGH and Lahey portals along with other official medical records which refute most of the claims made my Dr Lai. I’d like to have this issue resolved before my first meeting with Kim next week if possible.

The primary diagnosis F20.9 was probably copied from the Tewksbury discharge summary which was inaccurate, and should be especially obvious to Edinburgh now that nobody has reported seeing me with any psychotic symptoms for over 2 years. I am also willing to testify under oath in potential legal action against Tewksbury that I only experienced several relatively minor psychotic episodes caused by the misuse of medication, the first of which was Nov 18 and the last in Oct 20 with 3-4 in between. I experienced no psychosis before Nov 18 or after Oct 20 and am extremely sure of that now partly I have personal experience in what psychosis actually is

Apr 07, 2023  5:31:11 PM

I'm also concerned that Edinburgh's records about me from the past only contained a lot of untrue negative information obtained via the Tewksbury Discharge Summary. It didnt include the incredibly effective adhd treatment I received from Aug 17 to Nov 18, which I can support with medical records from MGH and academic transcripts. It also doesn't include my entire life's history of struggling with untreated anxiety/panic, adhd, depression, and ASD which was detailed in the neuropsych evaluation but since it was untreated there's not much other medical records, although I can provide supporting evidence with other types of records.

Also the second opinion provider said he will provide me with an after visit summary with his opinions by tomorrow morning hopefully in time to see Kim. I’d also like to bring in 1.5 years of medical records from MGH and other places describing very successful treatment for the conditions that I suffered through my entire life but was only properly treated for 2 years of, including the past 6 months at Edinburgh. I feel like it’s impossible to obtain gainful employment without proper treatment for my conditions which Dr Harrison, MGH, and a few other doctors were thankfully able to do for me.

Me
Also I was informed by the second opinion provider to make sure to be totally sure that a prescribed is OK with giving me a little “flexibility” in taking ADHD medication like I mentioned to you earlier before after doing it. I thought that it was typical of prescribers to give people a little flexibility because I was told that in the past at MGH, but I will be 100% sure not to take more than prescribed unless given explicit permission to do so in the future. My mom is monitoring my medication daily as well as well being and will continue reporting to Frank every week.

Hi Ramona,

I had an initial evaluation as a new patient with a new PCP with De Wei Yang. The reason for switching is that Dr Yang is a family friend and a former colleague of my mother, so is more likely to provide better personalized care compared to previous/current (I guess) PCP. She’s also highly intelligent and part of the Harvard Vanguard network so she was able to refer me to in-network nutritionists and second opinion behavioral health. (I’ve yet to schedule an appointment but got the referrals) Dr Yang suggested that Phentermine may be appropriate for weight loss (blood pressure, heart rate, and EKG was fine; blood test tomorrow morning) but she should coordinate with Kim regarding Vyvanse + Phentermine. I mentioned to Dr Yang that I was on 100mg Vyvanse + 10mg Dexedrine daily from MGH for a year, and before misuse/abuse of medication my health records, vitals, blood tests, and other tests were fine on a higher dose of stimulants, so the Phentermine was likely fine. Dr Yang said she may start the Phentermine next month after she reviews my blood test scheduled for 8am tomorrow.

Also could you please let me know when the Ambien prescription (Kim said she renewed 10 Ambien to CVS and 30 Vyvanse to Pelmeds to be distributed however you wanted; so I guess you can give me 6 or 8 at a time etc as you desire) is sent to CVS? The trouble caused by my dad’s actions makes the Ambien kind of useful to have ASAP.

Thanks so much,
Bo

Dr Yang asked if I wanted her to take over the psychiatric meds and I answered no. I instead asked for referrals for in-network (free) second opinions to Harvard Vanguard behavioral health. I was honest about my medical records including misuse/abuse from Nov 18 - June 20. I was also honest about hospitalizations. Dr Yang did not believe I have substance abuse or other mental health concerns presently and only referred me for ADHD, anxiety, and possible depression. (ASD was not a choice in the referral, but these 4 diagnosis is consistent with my Sep 2017 neuropsych evaluation, MGH health records, and the opinions of Frank and Nick) Kim also said she would look into updating my diagnosis since they were written on Tewksbury Discharge Summary before Edinburg ever got a chance to see me, and was never updated. Dr Yang said it may be appropriate to ask Kim for “anxiety medication” for my Dad’s behavior but she didn’t want to step in Kim’s foot for now since I asked Dr Yang to not take over my psychiatric meds. I presume Dr Yang was referring to the 3-day supply of very low dose of Xanax my PCP prescribed last month, but while I won’t say no to a prescription, I also don’t believe it’s necessary. I believe most anxiety is caused by concentration problems including concentration required to deal with my dad’s legal issues. I’m just being transparent in reporting all of this since it’s what Kim suggested.

Hi Bo, how are you? I just spoke with CVS and they said a 30 day supply of Vyvanse was picked up on 8/25 - I’m clarifying as Frank mentioned you said you may be in need of a refill soon. Please let me know if there’s any confusion I can help clarify about the medication orders, thank you. Ramona

Sep 07, 2023 12:45:06 PM (Read by them after 2 seconds)

+17814434721
Thank you for clarifying. I’m not sure what happened with the Invega delivery from PACT - I apologize about that. the prescription was sent to CVS on 8/14 - were you able to fill it at CVS?

Sep 07, 2023  1:26:24 PM (Read by them after 1 second)

I was able to but had to pay out of pocket ($212) cuz it was sent to PACT and insurance wouldn’t cover it. But instead of throwing it away, I was wondering if I could have the delivery to PACT as backup if needed?

Sep 07, 2023  2:48:21 PM (Read by you after 1 minute, 20 seconds)
+17814434721
I’m so sorry to hear of the payment - please call or stop by PACT if that happens again as you shouldn’t have to pay out of pocket. Please do not pick up next month’s refill and we will deliver the box we have at PACT. The refills will remain active and you can ask the pharmacy to fill them even with the one month gap. We can’t just deliver it to you since you were able to fill the prescription as that wouldn’t be as ordered but extra. Hope that makes sense.

Hi Bo - Pelmeds delivered one month of Vyvanse to our office and so please don’t refill at CVS as we will deliver it to you two weeks at a time for one month and then the order will be placed to CVS again. Sorry for the inconvenience. Also, please let me know when you are out of Invega as we have 16 tablets at the office which Pelmeds delivered prior and we will bring them to you. I can drop them off on Thursday if that works as they’ll expire October 7th.
