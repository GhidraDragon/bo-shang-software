Hey sorry for missing your call. This is CTT1 Maloney. Just listened to your voicemail and can absolutely get you set up with a Navy recruiter as well. When’s a good time to call you back?

I'm available tomorrow after 11am, or anytime next Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

Thanks!
Bo

Do you know if the waiver rule for ADHD is a hard 1 year? Or is there a possibility the Navy would consider a candidate with good qualifications on shorter time?
