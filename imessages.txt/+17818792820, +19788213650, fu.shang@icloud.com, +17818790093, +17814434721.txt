William Garrett patient notes sent to me yesterday. Multiple minor factual errors but generally OK. Not a lot of insight besides agreeing with Dr Harrison and Kim. Will seek 2nd opinion from MGH Bressler who specialize in ASD and ADHD or Harvard Vanguard instead

By "agree" I'm not sure if he would have came up with the same suggestions if I didn't tell him what Dr Harrison and Kim said to me first. He seemed to just copy and paste my message to him regarding what Dr Harrison and Kim told me. Im just looking for experts at MGH or Harvard Vanguard who may or may not be able to offer their own insights
