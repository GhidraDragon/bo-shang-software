It's President Biden. I wanted to say thanks for being a Democrat, and for working so hard for our shared vision for this country.

I know you probably get a lot of fundraising emails and texts, so please know that every dollar you contribute to the DNC is greatly appreciated and helps the team make big investments to strengthen our party.

I know the DNC is so grateful for your support. And I am too! 

Thank you,

Joe
