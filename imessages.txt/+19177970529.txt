I'll be thinking up ideas based on need, particularly for business. B2B SAAS companies have the highest rate of successful scaling and exits when compared to any other startup category. I'll present ideas for startups which are reasonably able to be built with 1-2 engineers, but also have ability to scale into something far more complex needing 25+ engineers.

What way are you trying to help people? Are you trying to help society and make the world a better place? Or help people with productive and efficiency for example? I have ideas for both. 

Aug 30, 2023  9:43:20 AM
Me
well the purpose of business is to help others and not to exploit others; that’s the whole point of economics and trade

Aug 30, 2023  9:43:37 AM

Otherwise money or even barter doesn’t make sense

Aug 30, 2023  9:44:20 AM

So for example illegal gambling doesn’t help people, and fraud doesn’t help people, and theft doesn’t help people

I'll also share the vision on the company I'm currently building which I think you may find interesting. It's a way to make social media platforms be beneficial to the world instead of harmful by promoting influencers and content creators who look to educate others in specific skills, traits, or talents. So that way they can be the major influencers and not the Pokimanes of the world who are just destroying our society.

I hate how social media has destroyed our society and how pathetic influencers like Pokimane and Amours have so much influence over people. It's turns my stomach. And those gambling influencers who promote gambling. It needs to change.

Social media is a tight space though; like how many people are going to create digital content or educate others?

Aug 30, 2023 10:36:41 AM

Maybe a communication app, but there are lots of those; maybe a blockchain that does computation?

A lot, and I'll explain how I mean it when we connect on Monday. I'll walk you through the plan. But that's only 1 of many ideas I'll present you with.

most people like do physical stuff though; not digital stuff

Or are you referring to physical stuff in social media videos?

    I'm always open for business advice from anyone. Business is a mentality, not a subject. It's often instinctive and innate. The GMAT is business theory which rarely applies to the real world. Hence why some VCs stay away from MBA founders. Your business advice is always appreciated and welcomed because I have confidence in your thought process. 


Aug 31, 2023 12:19:25 PM
+19177970529
I just thought up of an interesting B2C startup which I believe could be hugely promising. There may be some like it that already exist, but that have no real big presence or footprint. 

Since services are paid for in after tax income, both parties could save considerable money.  

Imagine a marketplace in which people exchange services for one another. For example, a contractor can do renovation work in exchange for legal services. This way the lawyer gets to have his renovations done while the contractor receives the legal work required. 

A web designer can provide services in exchange for wedding planning. The web designer can have his wedding planned while the wedding planner can have a fresh and more engaging website designed to promote the business. 

Of course as with any marketplace, we have to monitor the services to ensure there is nothing involving illegal or sexual activities.

Then did some business school and did well before dropping out cuz I rather do CS

That's a lower priority idea. Profit margins will be razor thin. It's not really economically viable on its own. I would have established it to be positioned as an acquisition target.

Using AI to pool together all information from a business to be able to create visual data graphics. So you can pull the data from Quick Books, sales analytics, app/website analytics, customer surveys, customer service calls, etc... and be able to have AI generate visual graphs based on what you search for.

We could use any data sets to play around with.

That is insight from my companies. Large companies have an extraordinary amount of data however are very limited in capacity to properly utilize all that data. It is also hugely expensive. 

Aug 31, 2023 12:32:57 PM (Read by you after 1 second)

Aug 31, 2023 12:34:54 PM (Read by you after 7 seconds)

Im not understanding. What would be beneficial to the companies is the ability to properly use all the data they have. It's a challenge both Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have with many complaints from employees. That we have all the data we need in some backend system but are unable to efficiently pull the data and make it understandable.

+19177970529
Simply put, a great need for businesses is to be able to extrapolate the data they have to make it usable. Unless your company had data scientists, software engineers, and other technical experts, it's very difficult to pull all the data needed. 

Aug 31, 2023 12:38:27 PM

i mean we could help customer service, we could help like corporate managers, we could help Human Resources, we could help security, or we could help normal people

Would it be achievable if we focus on extrapolating and combining data from particular software used by restaurants? Restaurants are just being used as an example here. 

A restaurant uses software like OpenTable for reservations which show when and who is coming to restaurants. 

They then use other software for the ordering of food which shows data on the foods and drinks each table is ordering. 

Then they use other software like GrubHun for their takeout and ordering. 

Is it possible to create a platform in which we extrapolate and combine the data from each of these programs to provide the restaurant manager with visual data graphics? For example maybe the restaurant owner wants to know what the most popular food items are by time or season for the dine in and takeout customers. And then wants to know and determine patterns of when customers come into the restaurant and what the average party size is by time? 

Is it possible to feed all of this available data somewhere and then use AI to the extrapolate the data needed?

Possibly a good idea; I’m thinking about how easy it is for people to make stupid mistakes; so automation could help with that problem

Aug 31, 2023  1:02:35 PM (Read by you after 5 seconds)
+19177970529
Not just stupid mistakes, but of the millions of restaurants which have the highest fail rate of any business in the world, they rarely use data because they don't have the know how or resources. If we make it very simple for them to use it could be a game changer. $29.99 per month for a restaurant will have an immediate return on investment. The total addressable market is huge.

Awesome. Also I think you’ll have to be the one to apply for cloud credits since I already got them for AIWebAssist, but you could use a privacy.com card so you never get charged; well just use the free credits until we’re profitable.

How many engineers roughly would you say would be needed to use computer vision to assist in automatic tasks? For example if our AI assistant were to guide a user by highlighting fields on a screen. 

For example, using computer vision to see what is on a screen, so that the AI tool can tell a user where to click to accomplish a task?

Sep 01, 2023  2:16:36 PM (Read by you after 8 minutes, 58 seconds)
+19177970529
If it's even possible 

Sep 01, 2023  2:26:14 PM
Me
Like 1? Im not sure what you mean by highlighting fields on a screen but I could probably do it if it was simple in like a few minutes?

Sep 01, 2023  2:49:00 PM (Read by you after 24 seconds)
+19177970529
A simple example would be a user asking the AIWebAssist tool to help merge cells in excel. If you ask ChatGPT how to do that, it will give you accurate instructions on how to merge cells. So I was wondering if AIWebAssist can utilize computer vision to take the written instructions and then find and highlight fields on screen in order to guide a user exactly where to click to achieve the function.

Sep 01, 2023  2:49:55 PM
Me
I’ll let back to you; I’d have to think a bit

Sep 01, 2023  2:50:51 PM (Read by you after 9 minutes, 9 seconds)
+19177970529
So in other words, using computer vision to be able to see and understand what is on a user's screen so that WebAssist can guide a user. Because THAT will be a game changer for every user. That would also be a massive acquisition target company.  

Sep 01, 2023  3:00:34 PM
Me
It’s possible. I’m not sure how smart you want it to be though cuz LLMs work a little different architecturally 

Sep 01, 2023  3:02:34 PM
Me
We’d have to combine LLMs with machine vision which may be like very computationally expensive even if we can write an algorithm to do it auto rather than write manual algorithms

Sep 01, 2023  3:17:35 PM (Read by you after 1 hour, 17 minutes, 44 seconds)
+19177970529
Got it. It's def not something I expect to be done early on in the startup's cycle. I'm asking because I want to ensure that any idea we pursue has the ability to scale to $10b+ in revenue. Automating tasks alone will not be able to reach that level of scale. Even Zapier does only about $200million in yearly revenue. Implementing computer vision is the catalyst to scale up to $10b+ because then the capabilities are almost limitless. But I understand that is something for like a series C investment when the company finds a strong PMF and scalability.

Assuming we are a mid-size company with at least 5 engineers, how would you go about visually guiding a user on  a desktop program, like PowerPoint, to help them complete tasks they don't know how to do? 

In other words, if a grandma wants to user PowerPoint and wants to change the background style of her slide, how would you go about having an overlay on her screen highlight the steps on where to click. 

I'm asking strictly about the overlay on grandma's screen. NOT teaching the AI software how to navigate PowerPoint.

Sep 05, 2023  8:42:02 AM (Read by you after 11 seconds)
+19177970529
But this startup is my baby and is about to launch. I have a front end and back end developer, a social media manager, and growth manager already set. So you will have a minor equity share, but I can't ever guarantee you that you won't be fired. Nobody's job is a guarantee including my own once I start raising capital. That's how business is run. So with this startup I can't make that promise to you.

Assuming we are a mid-size company with at least 5 engineers, how would you go about visually guiding a user on  a desktop program, like PowerPoint, to help them complete tasks they don't know how to do? 

In other words, if a grandma wants to user PowerPoint and wants to change the background style of her slide, how would you go about having an overlay on her screen highlight the steps on where to click. 

I'm asking strictly about the overlay on grandma's screen. NOT teaching the AI software how to navigate PowerPoint.

No you'll be getting up to 60% of this startup so it's not free. You'll be a majority shareholder. 

Look at it this way. I'm pulling all my contacts and setting up meetings and drawing up ideas and running it by VCs to know which ideas are viable. I've already put in hours into determining if this is a good idea or not and working with VCs to get their input. So I've put time into this also and will continue to do so. I didn't get paid to do this, but I didn't do it for free per se. I did it for 40% equity ownership.

You have engineering abilities, I have business and corporate navigation abilities. Together we will be unstoppable. But we both need to act diplomatic at all times until we reach a high level scale of business. Then you can be as opinionated as you want.

Sep 05, 2023 10:32:37 AM (Read by you after 2 seconds)
+19177970529
So let's put some actionable steps together. 

Step 1 is for you to run the research on the viability of the startup that I mentioned earlier. Making a basic user into a power user. 

Step 1 for me was working with VCs to understand their interest in the business. That's been successful. Step 2 for me can only happen after you complete your step 1. 

Sep 05, 2023 10:33:24 AM (Read by you after 1 second)
+19177970529
Thanks Bo. But really I don't want you spending money on my twitch account. I never use it so a tier 3 gift will be a waste of your money. But thank you pal!

There is an urgent need here! It's exactly what I've been saying for months but we haven't made a move on it. I can see trends from a mile away, but I need your help to make it into reality. We can't postpone anymore. We need to start asap so that we are one of the first to market!

Thanks but I'm going to stay focused on at most two things. I recommend you do the same. Put you focus on 1 or two things and perfect those. 

Sep 05, 2023  3:06:02 PM
Me
Ok so do u want me to do ur thing or not?

Sep 05, 2023  3:07:08 PM
+19177970529
Ideally Yes. But I want you to see it as our thing. I already validated the business concept and VC interest. Now the next step is to validate the technical viability to see if it can be achieved. 

Sep 05, 2023  3:07:31 PM
+19177970529
Also, in the spirit of keeping the momentum going, let's schedule another meeting to discuss your findings. 

Let's call it Project Power User. 

Are you free on Sunday?

Sep 05, 2023  3:07:53 PM
Me
right but u get that I could do It really quickly if u just let me do it?

Sep 05, 2023  3:08:22 PM
Me
with a technical white paper + working code

Sep 05, 2023  3:08:54 PM
Me
So we’d need a contract or you could pay me for a white paper with a refund policy

Sep 05, 2023  3:09:16 PM
+19177970529
That's awesome that you can do it quickly. 

Sep 05, 2023  3:09:35 PM
Me
And possibly way better than gpt4 if u give me more time

Sep 05, 2023  3:09:48 PM
Me
but again we’d need a contract; and the law suit thing I need to do

Sep 05, 2023  3:09:55 PM
Me
Cuz I need to fuck Pokimane and Donald trump

Sep 05, 2023  3:10:06 PM

Plus help some other people

Sep 05, 2023  3:10:17 PM
Me
There will be plenty of time for other stuff later

Sep 05, 2023  3:11:23 PM
+19177970529
So those can be the two things you focus on. The lawsuit and Project Power User. 

Sep 05, 2023  3:11:35 PM
+19177970529
And I'll focus on my thing and also Project Power User. 

Sep 05, 2023  3:11:50 PM
Me
Ok so well need a contract for. The power user thing

Sep 05, 2023  3:12:20 PM
+19177970529
It's too early for a contract. Anyway, without a contract you hold all the intellectual knowledge. I am non technical 

Sep 05, 2023  3:12:23 PM
Me
i mean no shit an AGI with machine vision is useful

Sep 05, 2023  3:12:28 PM
+19177970529
Meaning a contract will protect me more than you. 

Sep 05, 2023  3:12:52 PM
Me
Oh ok If u don’t want the code

Sep 05, 2023  3:12:53 PM
Me
Then ill do it

Sep 05, 2023  3:13:03 PM
Me
Or even the technical white paper

Sep 05, 2023  3:13:29 PM
Me
Just a general feasibility without “protected” tech

Sep 05, 2023  3:13:33 PM
+19177970529
I just need to know the viability behind the technical ability to make Project Power User happen. You can write the code but I'm not asking for you to share the code. I just need a legitimate evaluation from your end it if it possible to be done, and on a high level how it can be achieved and to what degree. 

Sep 05, 2023  3:14:03 PM
Me
well how much of the white paper do u want? Cuz explaining the pseudo code is IP itself

Sep 05, 2023  3:14:05 PM
+19177970529
You do all the coding you want to run tests but you can hold on to that until we draw up a contract.  

Sep 05, 2023  3:14:52 PM
+19177970529
You could present me with all the code in the world, and I will not understand a single part of it. What I need to know from you is the level of achievability to do what project power user is aiming to do. But I need from your end is a technical evaluation on the degree in which it can be done.

Sep 05, 2023  3:15:22 PM
Me
Right but the white paper explaining the pseudo code enough or the code is IP that could be TRANSFRED
    Sep 05, 2023  3:15:58 PM
    +19177970529
    Sorry, but I'm not understanding. I don't know what pseudo code is nor do I know what IP is.


Sep 05, 2023  3:15:23 PM
+19177970529
If we determine that it is very feasible to achieve. Then we know that the technology is validated, and we can then proceed with drawing up a contract, and forming an actual incorporation.

Sep 05, 2023  3:15:30 PM
Me
Get it? It’s VALUE

Sep 05, 2023  3:19:43 PM (Read by you after 11 seconds)
+19177970529
So let's do this. Do research and evaluate the ability to achieve what Project Power User aims to achieve. If the technology is not viable then we scrap the idea or iterate it.  

Sep 05, 2023  3:20:00 PM
Me
It should be viable to some degree

Algorithmically it’ll cost more than 1 hour to do and write a technical white paper and prove it works on distributed gpu cloud, so maybe you should help with some thing too

Google assitant meets gpt meets machine vision laptop OS or rooted/custom android is coming, and full auto ML algo, how large is going to be the fucking model?

It’s doable, but how much demo code do you want

Sep 06, 2023  5:09:05 AM (Read by them after 1 second)

Easily doable full auto I think with RL + gpt copying

Sep 06, 2023  5:09:36 AM

So there’s ur $2 of work of a white paper; but u need to be more specific in what you want

Sep 06, 2023  5:11:28 AM
Me
Cuz I don’t trust cloud and only have an m2 mac book for now. M2 ultra is on sep 20. No way I trust cloud with this full auto tech, unless I give up and trust them or put in security measures somehow

Sorry I talk like in short cuz I like to get stuff done

Sep 06, 2023  5:59:49 AM
Me
Cuz if I do this tech, I mean design of auto algo for AGI powerful, so even though you should spend as much time as benefits you, I’d like to see something in return in ur free time. Cuz I could pitch to VC myself too. And find an MBA, etc. I’m loyal ethically both ways and generous but it only goes so far

Sep 06, 2023  6:00:15 AM

Just make sure you have a contract for a refund option

I need hardware funding and internet funding lots of internet and hardware

I don’t think 3 months of YC is enough for AGI on OS that’s also legally compliant and ethical ideally with a warning pop up and totally secure, so you may want me to do something else, but I can do it for you, if you get VC for me

Bo I'm lost again on what you need from me. There are too many messages which diverge from the original point. I need us to be on the same page, and to communicate the needs concisely. You mentioned you need funding and hardware. Well to get hardware we need funding. So all I'm hearing so far is that you need funding. Please tell me precisely what else you need from me besides funding. 

Sep 06, 2023  9:02:29 AM

+19177970529
Ok. As far as honest and loyal CEO, you will get that from me in business and personal life. No exceptions. 

Pitching to VCs is in the realm of funding but that needs to be done AFTER we validate the technical achievability of what we're trying to build.

u might machine vision not OCR to detect non-words

remember UR CEO so u have Stripe admin login

Sep 06, 2023  9:13:25 AM

I’d have to sue back in but like im not going to do that cuz I won’t betray u for u to lock me out

Sep 06, 2023  9:14:55 AM

This way we get cloud credits and VC or business loans if needed for hardware and employees

Sep 06, 2023  9:14:59 AM
Me
And for YC too

Sep 06, 2023  9:15:34 AM

Like give me an employee card with a $100 limit if u want; like who cares

Me
And u and my mom investing with U being CEO helps with angel investors

Sep 06, 2023  9:17:28 AM
Me
Plus u could do the business shit once I write the code and need the hardware

Sep 06, 2023  9:17:36 AM

I mean build it like a home server

Sep 06, 2023  9:17:52 AM

This is for core tech; ill load the stuff google can’t steal on GCP

Or if it’s simple enough; we can use AWS GCP Azure

So we can use OCR to read text on a screen, and computer vision to detect icons.

The next thing we need to understand is two things:

1) Is it achievable to have an overlaid highlight over the text and icons on a desktop application? 

2) is it achievable to control a desktop application program, and to select certain buttons?

easily

Sep 06, 2023  9:20:43 AM

For 2) several ways are possible

Sep 06, 2023  9:21:12 AM

U could use machine vision again with RL which is fucking hard; or u could use GPT to generate a script; possible with RL to make GPT4 better

Sep 06, 2023  9:21:39 AM (Read by you after 1 second)

Sep 06, 2023  9:22:17 AM

So if you were to run the most bare bone and simple MVP to:

1) Build a software which uses OCR to read text on a screen.

AND

2) let the MVP know which text should be highlighted on the screen as an overlay

How long and what recourses would you need to achieve this?

I have spent a lot of time brainstorming the idea. I have worked with different venture capital founders to determine their levels of interest if we can validate the idea. I am offering you the vast majority of the shares of the startup. I am literally telling you that you can be a 99% Founder. If all of that doesn't exhibit, loyalty, and blind trust that I am giving you then I don't know what will. And that's what I mean that our personalities are not a good fit because we see things way too differently. You measure contributions strictly based on quantitative measures. As a CEO my abilities come in the form of subjective measures. Relationship management, network, venture capital fundraising, foreseeing and understanding the trends, and the opportunities in which the startup can flourish. The value I provide is long-term, whereas the value that you provide as an engineer will be diminished with each additional engineer that is on boarded. Whereas my value will continue growing as I navigate this startup into a large scale enterprise business. So I am giving you the loyalty and trust Bo, you just don't see it in me, despite me giving you a huge percentage of the business.

I'm concerned about titles, but VC firms are. Im sure they'd rather someone who has worked in a large scale corporate environment in finance in a top NY firm to act as CEO. You being CTO is best. But don't forget, if you have majority it means you have the final say anyway. It's just a view that we have to make me CEO. But in reality, you have majority power

Bo, forget it all. Just run with it alone. Building a product takes a lot of work, but so does establishing and growing a business. Also, my vast network is worth a lot, and my connections and abilities to connect with the right people needed. You keep quantifying everything. Wozniak built the Apple computer but Steve Jobs built Apple the business. Both played essential parts, although Woz played a more important role earlier but then because less important as time went on. And Vice versa for Jobs. If you can't see the value I am able to bring in both the short and long term then we are just not a good fit.

I'll give you some parting advice. The CEO of a company needs to understand and define the vision, strategy, and approach on how to build, scale and flourish the business. That includes being able to connect tech teams, with growth teams, with marketing and legal and risk management and media teams. The CEO needs to be a leader of all. He does not need to know the minute details on how the product is built, only its limitations and capabilities. 

So when looking for a CEO, you should look at those traits. Otherwise all you're doing is creating redundancy between the CTO sand CEO role. 

Yes, it helps if the CEO is technical. But people can learn to code, but being a true leader is something that comes innately and can't be taught.
