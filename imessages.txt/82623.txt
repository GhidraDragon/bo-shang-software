It's the 1st day of Pride Month, and we're in the middle of a crisis:

Trans healthcare bans. 
Trans sports bans. 
Trans bathroom bans. 
Drag bans. 

Politicians are trying to stop trans and gender-nonconforming people from making decisions about our bodies, our futures, and our lives. We need you to fight back.

Tell Congress to protect trans people from discrimination: http://lil.ms/m0uu/ae7eax

Lawmakers are passing dangerous restrictions to abortion and gender-affirming care.

We are filing lawsuits and providing legal defense to fight back, but we need more committed, monthly donors to keep up the fight.
