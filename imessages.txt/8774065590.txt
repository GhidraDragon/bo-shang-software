I am going to ask you to make another contribution of $40 today. Let me explain why.

Our campaign's next FEC filing deadline is in just four days.

Soon, we will report our total fundraising for the month and how many individual donors have joined our grassroots movement. We've set a goal to collect a few more contributions from your area by midnight on September 30, but we are coming up a bit short.

Bo, as one of my most reliable donors, I am asking you directly to power our efforts.

Will you make another $40 contribution to our campaign and Democrats nationwide today?

Thanks and take care,

Kamala Harris
