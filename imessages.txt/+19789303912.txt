Hey Bo, this is Yusi. I heard what's been going on from my mom. I'm so sorry that you and your mom are going through this. It sounds incredibly tough and stressful. Regarding your request- I'm so sorry, but I don't feel comfortable weighing in on his mental health. I definitely believe you and what you've experienced with him, but I don't feel comfortable making one suggestion or another. I'm always here though to be supportive to you and your mom. Let me know if/when you want to call and talk more over the phone!

Hi Yusi, Thanks so much for your message, and please pass along my appreciation to your mom and dad for relaying my message. I totally understand not feeling comfortable weighing in on his mental health. The good thing is that I was able to ask the assistant DA to include mental health treatment as part of his pretrial conditions and a judge agreed. However he's still deeply worrying in part because he claims he doesn't care about what happens in his criminal trial, doesn't care about whether he goes to jail, and wants to represent himself. I had to call the victims advocate to advocate for my dad's 6th amendment rights on his behalf. It's very annoying having to perform his self interests for him. I'd love to chat with you sometime you're free to catch up and perhaps discuss the anxiety relating to this issue. Otherwise I hope you're doing great and please have a wonderful rest of your week!

Hey!! Sorry for the delayed response, just getting back. I don't work until noon tomorrow if you wanna give me a call in the morning! I'm so so happy to hear that you're getting better and you're prioritizing your mental health. I've been so nervous about speaking candidly with you and asking directly how you were doing, and I'm so relieved and proud that you've gotten to where you are!

It sounds like a huge burden on you! But you shouldn't take all of the responsibility. At the end of the day it's up to him to want to be helped and get better so please don't feel like you're solely responsible for whatever happens with him. Take care of yourself and your mom first

Hey Bo, I am really worried about you. I am looking at your LinkedIn and it's making me very concerned that you're not well and you're having psychosis - and it sounds like you have some sense that something is wrong too? I think you should go to the ED. It'll be the safest for you there right now. If your mom is home please tell her what's going on!

Ok, do you mind me asking what's been the trigger? Your posts make me worried you're taking illicit stimulants which can often trigger psychosis so I wanted to check in - I feel like a "little psychosis" might take more than an NP visit to get better from! Any form of psychosis is a psych emergency that I'd recommend a higher level of care and monitoring

Oct 17, 2023  6:09:06 PM
Me
It's a little of that but also I was definitely not hallucinating being screwed with by some software companies etc. which triggered the cyclical effect. I've learned to determine better exactly how to tell when psychosis happens and today I've had basically none. It was just yesterday after legitimately being pranked with a little by various companies.

Hey I just reread some of the odd texts I sent most of which was during a blackout. I just wanted to explain that it was probably caused by whatever was in a bad batch of illicit Adderall (the effects were super obvious and immediate  after a few hours twice I tried) 

Otherwise I seem to be fine and thinking clearly 

Apr 28, 2024  9:40:15 AM
Me
All of the blackouts and psychotic symptoms went away after 12 hours of abstinence. I understand how the healthcare system needs to be cautious and how trying to do what I thought was maximizing my human potential by supplementing prescription Adderall with what I tried to be the optimal dose or productivity was a mistake, but all psychotic symptoms are gone after 12 hours (they're really notable and obvious) and punishing mistakes with anti psychotics and "danger to self or others" laws that involuntarily lock people up seem like "overly preventative" medicine

The hospitalization process is abusive given how patients are not allowed to have their medical records, other evidence, access to a computer, etc to mount a legal challenge guaranteed by the 14th amendment due process clause

The in patient psychiatrist didn't even speak to me once (basically) the daily in person "rounds" didn't ask any medical questions and were just like you have X days remaining on your 3 day and you forgot to sign a 3 day when you got in but too bad someone told you you did sign one

I don't think the system is set up to actually reflect Federal and Massachusetts due process legal standards and plan to sue to make the system more fair for every person involuntarily hospitalized in accordance with due process and other human rights guarantees under Federal and State Constitutional law

There's no money in it; I just want to bring the evidence to the attention of the court, and perhaps guarantee more personal freedoms for all affected since I believe the evidence shows I was clearly not a material danger to self or others even under the worst periods of substance misuse

Hi Dr. Kim, 
 
I will be attending the 1 hour in person appointment tomorrow, but following that I do not believe we are a good fit, and you probably feel similarly, to continue with the patient-doctor relationship. The main reason I'm citing this was that even though the 1 bad of whatever was in the illicit "Adderall" I ordered to do what I thought was maximize my human potential at the time, which I in retrospect obviously mistakenly tried twice and had obviously noticible negative effects including memory blackouts, I was still not materially a danger to self or others and I believe borderline did not meet the "substancial likelihood of danger to self or others" as legally required under Section 12 or 35. I do not hold any grudges against you and believe most psychiatrists and doctors would have done the same thing, but I believe seeing someone new is in the best interest of what I could get done in my career and life, as I do think at least the prescription Adderall at those doses substancially benefitted me, and it's highly unlikely you'll continue them until indefinately if/when you decide to give me a second chance on them.
 
Also this is irrelevant of our relationship but I do not believe the Section 12 and 35 legal processes in Massachusetts meets the Federal 14th Amendment and Massachusetts Constitutional requirements for "due process" which is defined as having a "fair" judicial process. cont...

For example patients are not allowed to have access to medical records or other evidence, access to a computer, word processor, Internet, or printer to mount a legal challenge, and the count-appointed lawyers in my recollection have been negligently incompetent at best. One of my court appointed lawyers made several gross MA Supreme Judicial Court violations on record and I'm currently in litigation with a judge in the Lowell District Court over negligence as allowed by MGL c123 Section 9 currently litigated in C.A. No. 248CV00396.

Anyways I'd like to explain what actually happened. I had roughly 12-hour long blackouts which were very very noticible after trying, twice unfortunately, whatever was in the illicit "Adderall" I ordered to at that time supplement the prescription to achieve what I believed was to be my human potential. I guess that was a mistake but I don't really regret trying to learn an important lesson about illicit medication. However even during the blackouts I don't believe I met the legal standard for "danger to others" and at most I barely met the standards for myself. All psychotic, confusion, disorientation, or memory blackout symptoms promptly disspeared 24 hours after ingestation. 
 
I called and texted my cousin Yusi Gong, which I acatually have no memory of besides reading the texts, who is practicing internal medicine doctor at Beth Israel, shortly after I didn't feel well after ingestation about the problem. She asked my Mom to drive me to the ER. It was very similar to the first Section 12 you put me on in early April due to exactly the same problem caused by the same batch of illicit "Adderall." Anyways the doctor at the inpatient unit at HRI Hospital didn't even ask anything medically of me during the daily "rounds" he did, and the conversation basically boiled down to "well your 3 day notice is up on Friday" and "too bad you were told you signed a 3 day noticed on intake but that was actually a CV and there's nothing we could do about it" (despite being lied to legally)

Anyways I intend to introduce all of the evidence in my text messages, any other hard evidence, medical records, and daily diary of what happened at HRI Arbor, read the MA legislation carefully, read Federal and MA Constitutional requirements for "due process" carefully, and mount a legal challenge to this entire process of Sections 12 and 35. There's no money in it but I believe it'll substancially increase the freedoms of all those affected if my legal challenge is successful.

Also this sounds stupid but could you check if there is in fact a legal process to recall a controlled substance prescription legally, besides the Section 12 and 35 processes? Because I think if there isn't one afforded to even the prescribing doctor of an already filled medication then I have the legal right to reclaim my last month of prescription Adderall and Ambien from Dr Kim. 

Apr 28, 2024 10:24:22 AM
Me
Obviously he's not going to continue prescribing after I told him I would be looking for alternative providers, and I think legally unless you think I "pose a substantial danger to self or others" you're required to give the prescription medication back? 

Apr 28, 2024 10:39:34 AM

I called the Burlington Police Department about the legality of confiscating prescription controlled substances other than the Section 12 and 35 processes which requires that I pose a "substantial danger to self or others" they told me to call Brookline PD to require my medication. Is there any way we could talk about this?

Apr 28, 2024 10:41:18 AM

I recall having almost a full month of Adderall and Ambien (they were prescribed on 4/1 and dispensed on 4/2) and I only had like 5 days outside of the hospital since then, so they're kind of important for either just 3 weeks of use or until I get to see a new provider

I'm not saying how much you have, this is just how much I remembered having the day of the ER intake but my Mom seems to have gone through it as well shortly before then while I was disoriented.

Do you have an officer's name? I don't believe in your lies and I would think Brookline PD would say even this text is suspicious. "Don't tell them anything" really? Does that sound like a police department?

BTW ordered exactly 35 more "Adderalls" but from a more reputable vendor with thousands of 5 star reviews to replace what you illegally stole. You are free to inform the police about this as well and I do not believe they'll charge me with possession given the legal facts of what you did. I'd be happy to provide a screenshot and when it was delivered etc. I learned that as long as I don't infringe on the rights of others nothing criminally could happen to me in America basically

Man I hope to issue a year long restraining order for you and Mom soon and have it heard in Woburn District and Boston District court. Illegal incarceration through Section 12 literal lies and theft of controlled substances etc. My mom claims I voluntarily called you for help but I did blackout so im questioning whether she forced me to do it against my will. This happened several times and even in college numerous students blacked out for several hours from alcohol which wasn't unusual and seriously people don't deserve to be metaphorically raped when blacked out.

Investment opportunity for PDFSage, from an Engineering alum


Dear investmentpartners@invoff.trustees.tufts.edu,

I am writing to introduce you to PDFSage Inc., a Delaware C Corp registered in December 2024. I am Bo Shang, an Engineering alum of Tufts University, and I currently own 100% of the equity in PDFSage.

PDFSage is building a central documents hub and is exploring expanding this to include photos. We have quality starter code available on Github. Our focus is on creating AI-powered solutions, and we are currently developing AIController, a TFLite model designed to control all things AI, that runs on mobile SoCs.

This morning, we successfully trained and deployed a "stupidity detect" TF-node model in just 2 hours. While training on a mobile 4070 took only half a second, AWS Amplify indicates the model is too large for deployment.

In the past two days, PDFSage has released two iOS apps: one for all things PDF, which supports bulk action and watermarking, and another called Info & Tools, which we believe is the most advanced Swiss Army Knife app on the iOS platform, fully utilizing all sensors and SoC capabilities.

PDFSage is eager to succeed and welcomes any helpful advice. However, we are also confident in our ability to achieve our goals, even with AFK investors.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Bo Shang

1.1 only; 1.0 sucked but

1.1 coming up with TFLite AIController to control all things...

Allegations of Extended Theft/Interference with ADHD Medication (7-Year Period)
	24.	For the past seven (7) years, Plaintiff contends that:
	•	The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and various local police departments have repeatedly seized or destroyed Plaintiff’s ADHD medication without due process, thus exacerbating Plaintiff’s ADHD and causing severe mental and emotional distress.
	•	Parents and relatives of Plaintiff, in direct collaboration or tacit approval from law enforcement or healthcare providers, have also taken, withheld, or destroyed Plaintiff’s medication, sometimes arguing that Plaintiff should not have it, or claiming they knew better about his medical needs.
	•	These actions left Plaintiff debilitated, depressed, and nearly unable to function, causing him to retreat from productive activities and nearly “cease to exist” in everyday life for extended periods.
	25.	Plaintiff alleges that once on the proper ADHD medication—including what is referred to as “improvised” or counterfeit Adderall—he was able to:
	•	Develop two iOS apps, one being PDFSage, a world-class PDF utility featuring OCR editing, bulk processing, machine vision scanning, and more.
	•	Launch a Web Portal and integrated applications that link to PDFSage.
	•	Build several Android apps along the way.
	•	Contribute positively to society and earn potential revenue from advanced AI features, without posing any public threat whatsoever.
	26.	Plaintiff acknowledges that possession of counterfeit Adderall (methamphetamine) is generally illegal under Massachusetts and federal law. However, Plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of enforcing those prohibitions under circumstances where he has been systematically denied legitimate prescription medication. Plaintiff asserts that denying him any ADHD medication that works effectively violates:
	•	The Fourteenth Amendment (due process and equal protection)
	•	The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and related statutes
	•	Massachusetts civil rights laws
	•	UN treaties to which the U.S. is a signatory (e.g., international standards for the rights of persons with disabilities).
	27.	Plaintiff thus seeks an emergency injunction to prevent the confiscation or criminalization of the ADHD medication he requires, whether or not the medication is deemed “counterfeit,” until or unless there is a legitimate and constitutional basis to deny it.
	28.	Plaintiff underscores that he is not a danger to himself or others while on his ADHD medication and that such medication is crucial for him to maintain a meaningful existence and the ability to engage in software engineering. Further, UN treaties and international human rights norms support the principle that persons with disabilities must be granted reasonable accommodations and not deprived of essential treatments solely based on paternalistic or discriminatory beliefs.

EXHIBIT 8: On January 9 2025, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the US District Court of Northern California granted literally 100% of the Plaintiff’s (Bo) request in a Motion to Amend or join Apple and Google in a lawsuit vs Twitch. The defense attorneys argued for a rejection of the motion with prejudice, and lost horrifically in their ad-hominem attack

EXHIBIT 9: On January 12, 2025, Plaintiff Bo filed a Motion to Amend joining Apple and Google in his lawsuit against Twitch, in an effort to defend the rights of Americans and Internet users around the world

I Bo Shang, on today January 25 2025, swear under perjury that nearly 100% of the motivation of filing these lawsuits is altruism and to defend the rights of Americans and communities around the world. In mid 2023 President Biden wrote to Bo regarding these abridged rights, and now Bo is taking action.

Coming soon in 1.6
Inspired by the MQ-1 Reaper drone and Hellfire fire-and-forget missiles, I decided to use LiDAR and some clever math combining LiDAR with machine vision on iOS Pro models, to create an automated fire-and-forget weapons system very similar to the MQ-1 equipped with Hellfire missiles in Project Maven. I may use a Raspberry Pi 4 I'm not sure yet, to control the hardware. Raspberry Pi is a pretty solid hardware controller and has variable voltage out to directly control an electric motor.
In a related lawsuit, the developer Bo Shang has made application security threats into Twitch systems, past Apple and Google's operating systems, in Federal court here: https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?436941
Docket number 14 and 30 are opinions by the Judge, and docket 31 contains my application security threats. My 2020 Github repository "Project Maven Twitch" featuring a list of "criminal_suspects" is near completion.
Project Maven (officially Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team) is a Pentagon project involving using machine learning and data fusion to process data from many sources, identify potential targets, display information through a user interface, and transmit human decisions to weapon systems, among other functions. It began in 2017. Since 2021, it had been used in multiple military conflicts involving the US.
Salt Typhoon with its investigation called off by the Trump Administration already, with only Verizon out of all US telecommunications networks claiming it repelled the hackers, makes everything look super vulnerable, and the reality is that humans are vulnerable regardless of whom you may be.
In 1.4 and 1.5: However unlike ungodly expensive cars that will never self drive despite marketing data, which may make a consumer lawsuit viable I'm not sure, since this iOS pro models, DOES have LiDAR and continuous mapping up to a certain limitation, there are probably possibilities of tagging people to shoot, while maintaining continuously accurate geospacial awareness of phone, tag, and automated weapons system. I have to go shopping for programmable weapons systems soon... There are other ways to implement weapons systems and I'll explore all of them... thank you TIm Apple for brining LiDAR to a phone to play around with and learn from.
The home screen displays core device information such as model and OS version numbers, and dynamically updated information for the CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, etc.
The Device Sensor Tools button on the top takes you to useful tools that rely on the device sensors; try out LiDAR especially around corners!
The Kali Clone Tools button on the top right takes you to very basic tools found in Kali Linux, the most advanced penetration testing platform ever. In the future smart tools may be added but try actual Kali for real pentest this is just a tease.
If anyone has robots or tools that are actually workable with Apple Vision (or better custom import) 5x telephoto 12mp, or other UI Tools (tools that within this app, is just a UI connected to external) that may make sense, feel free to contact at bo@pdfsage.org
