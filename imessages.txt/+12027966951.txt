Hi Bo this is Kathy volunteering with ACLU People Power. Politicians are trying to play political games with refugees' lives by destroying asylum protections and expanding the use of rapid deportation proceedings for immigrants in exchange for unrelated foreign aid funding. Can we count on you to call your member of congress now and ask them to reject extreme anti-immigrant measures?
