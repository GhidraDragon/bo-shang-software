Hi Nick. Dr Harrison called me yesterday and said she wrote me a prescription for Vyvanse, but CVS today said they havenâ€™t received anything. I was wondering if you knew how to get in contact with her to ask what happened? Thanks

Hi Nick,

I hope your new job is treating you well. I know you donâ€™t work for PACT anymore but since you were so helpful in the past (which Iâ€™m very grateful of), I was wondering if you or someone you know could help me in this matter.

Iâ€™m looking for a qualified lawyer with experience in Constitutional Law and with the Americans with Disabilities Act to offer me private legal advice. Iâ€™m willing to pay a $5k retainer to the lawyer and $1k to someone who helps me find that lawyer.

I recently filed a police misconduct complaint which I think has merit and the Burlington Police Department is currently investigating. I plan to forward complaints to the DoJ because they sometimes offer relief to victims. 

If youâ€™re willing to look into this matter, I was wondering if I could email you the complaints so you could take a quick look at them? (If so what is your email?)

Best regards either way,
Bo

Iâ€™ve put the information and evidence on Google Drive. 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SpNju9eOvlJEwMDAol7NPl8E5WYqURHy 

Thereâ€™s approximately 5 pages of information and evidence in total. 

The alleged police misconduct has caused me a great deal of trauma and Iâ€™d highly appreciate it if you could could pass along this information to someone qualified who may be able to help. None of the information is protected under any privacy law and you may share this link with anyone you like.

Thanks so much, Bo
