I'm trying to reach you on behalf of the postal service regarding your application for USPS employment. You received 2 emails that have time sensitive links that must be responded to within 72 hours of these emails landing in your inbox to continue being considered for the position.

 

1st Email is from ecareerworkflow@usps.gov   The subject will say accept or decline. There is a link at the bottom of that email that you must go through to accept or decline the job offer.

 

2nd Email you received came from NoreplyNACI@uspis.gov  this is the criminal background check you must register an account with Pangea and answer the SF85 questioner. You only get one chance to complete this in a 30-day period no matter how many applications you submit so you dont want to miss completing the NACI if you are looking to become a Federal Postal Employee.

 

If you have completed either of these already do not be alarmed this text is meant as a courtesy in the event you did not see one or both emails in the hopes that you can locate them and complete all required tasks before the links expire.

 

3rd You also must get fingerprinted timely please keep your eyes open for an email that will specify open house days times and locations open for printing and attend the earliest session you are able to. Bring your driverâ€™s license and your social security number to the open house session.

 

After you complete all these steps continue monitoring your emails in the event you need to provide any additional information.

If no additional updates are needed you will receive a call from a 617 # once your background check clears and you are ready for placement.
