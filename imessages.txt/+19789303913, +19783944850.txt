￼I apologize for my Dad’s actions. His behavior do not represent the values of my Mom and I. Thanks so much for helping my Mom through this troubling time. I have attached two screenshots of my dad threatening to harm my mom on WeChat, one being translated. If my Dad causes problems please relate this information to the police. Thanks so much for your help.

Thanks so much! I’m trying to get my dad to think sanely again but it’s ultimately his own choice. Have a great weekend!

He just attempted to strike mom roughly a dozen times and I was able to intercept around 9 of them. He still managed to kick her twice and punch her once. He also threatened to murder my mom, said that my mom could call the police but that he would murder her after he got out of jail, and repeatedly said it was better off that she was dead. I managed to record the part where he treated to murder my mom and said that if she called the police he would murder her if he got out of jail. She still seems unwilling to call the police herself but I have reported this to the police because she’s unreasonably asking me to “protect” her. I’ve put the video recording as well as the 3 emails I wrote to police (starting this morning, then updating when the violence/threats escalated)

Mom just called 911 but she was way too conservative in what she said so I took over. 2 officers are on their way

Sorry to hear that. Is your Mom ok?

Yep; I just hope he learns his lesson and doesn’t do anything worse (I literally told him what was legal and what wasn’t over and over again before he struck her), and that my mom doesn’t need to keep asking me to “protect” her anymore

Court at 9am where my mom will request a restraining order. I will attempt to ask a judge to order some mandatory mental health treatment as pretrial conditions of release. He is clearly manic depressive. He goes through long periods of depression then long periods of high energy manic episodes when he says that he’s sleeping 2 hours a night, his memory is “perfect”, and that he’s thinking about all his decisions logically and would never make mistakes. My mom called his family in Inner Mongolia and they all say my dad has been suffering from mental health conditions. He has refused to even try see any mental health providers who may be able to help. Since Yusi is a doctor, I was wondering, only if you’re comfortable, if you could pass this information to her so she may also suggest (via 1 text or something) to see a provider? He may respect Yusi’s opinion since she’s a doctor

I’m obviously not asking Yusi to formally make any diagnosis or treat him. I was wondering if she could evaluate my last message and offer an informal suggestion to my dad based on it (if she wants other info I’d be happy to provide at all)

Hi Bo, Thank you the update. We will call Yusi tonight and let you know asap.

Awesome thanks so much! It would be nice to re-connect with her regardless since I had a hard time doing so after getting out of the hospital due to depression and not getting anything done without ADHD, so I was just too ashamed to say much when she asked how I was doing. But I’m back on legally prescribed ADHD meds now and following doctors orders exactly and have made lots of progress, so I can adequately do small talk if she asks again

Great to hear you've been making good progress recently. Fully understand the situation.

I was thankfully able to briefly explain to the assistant district attorney my dad’s mental health problems and she petitioned the court to require mental health treatment and the court agreed. Interestingly my dad told his lawyer that my mom “intended” to stay at your home “for the duration of the trial”, which could last up to 1 year not including delays, which was why he was banned from going to your home but not ours. However he’s also not allowed to go within 100 yards of my mom by both pretrial of conditions of release and a restraining order, which effectively bars him from our home while my mom is present. He’s already violated these terms and is still aggressive.

Is it because your mother was not there in the end, so the court only listened to one party's defense. Did your mother hire a lawyer?

It’s a criminal case so it’s the state of Massachusetts represented by the assistant DA against my dad; my mom didn’t voice her opinions clearly or something so they put my dad’s restrictions to your house and not ours

Watch this YouTube video carefully which was the 2nd time Brookline Police instructed me to head down to Boston PD Precinct 2 to file police report. Will do it before appointment with Dr Kim at 2pm today. I hope Yusi gets arrested if she lied about turning over my medication to the police.

Go talk to my parents and try to witness intimidate if you want. It doesn’t work. I have all the evidence (these picture of a separate trial in which my dad is charged with assault and battery on me) in my backpack but it was raided empty by Yusi or my Mom last week. I have purchased a lock and GPS location tracker with LTE and battery backup so I could inform police of location
