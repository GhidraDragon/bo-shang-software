Bo, it’s Jill. Joe is debating Donald Trump, and we need a BIG surge of support right now from Democrats in your community. That’s why I’m turning to you -- someone who has been by Joe’s side throughout this reelection campaign. Will you pitch in $74 to ensure Trump never becomes president again? https://bfptxt.com/59z0VZ

Hey folks, it’s Joe. On Thursday, I spent 90 minutes debating on a stage with a guy who has all the morals of an alley cat. 

I know I’m not a young man. I don’t walk as easily as I used to. I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to.

I also know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.

And I know -- like millions of Americans know -- when you get knocked down, you get back up.

I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul that I can do this job. Because quite frankly the stakes are too high.

You’re one of my campaign’s strongest donors. It’d mean a lot to me to see another donation $74 from you come through for my reelection campaign and our party today:

Donald Trump and I will meet on the debate stage again in September. Until then, I’ll never stop fighting for families like yours just as I have every day of my career. 

I hope you’ll keep the faith and join me out on the stump. 

See you out there,

Joe

Folks, it’s President Biden. This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. That each of us is equal before the law. That no one is above the law.

Not even the President of the United States.

Yesterday’s decision by the Supreme Court removes virtually all limits on what the president can do.

So now, the American people must decide whether they want to entrust the presidency to Donald Trump knowing he'll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases, whenever he wants.

I'm asking you to help save the America we know: An America in which presidents tell the truth, uphold the law, defend democracy, and protect our fundamental freedoms. I'm asking you to rush another $74 contribution for the sake of our country.

You can use this link to give to Team Biden-Harris today: https://bfptxt.com/5xDW0H

Bo, it's President Joe Biden. Let me be clear: I'm running. 

I'm the Democratic Party’s nominee. No one is pushing me out. I'm not leaving, I'm in this race to the end, and WE are going to win this election. 

If you’re able, pitch in a few bucks now to help Kamala, me, and Democrats nationwide defeat Donald Trump in November >>

Donald Trump just chose J.D. Vance as his running mate.

How does a guy who used to say that Donald Trump and his policies were “reprehensible” become Donald Trump’s running mate? Through years of rubber-stamping Donald Trump’s extreme, MAGA agenda. You might even say he’s the poster child for Project 2025.

If you’ve been waiting for the perfect moment to join our team, then let me tell you, Bo -- that time is now. Make another donation today. We’re tracking donations at this link:

Thank you.

Hey Bo, it’s Adam Kinzinger. I’m a proud conservative, and I’m reaching out to you because today is the last day of the Republican National Convention -- and President Biden needs your support.

I might not agree with President Biden on everything, but I know that he will always protect our democracy. And I know that we both value truth, freedom, and upholding the Constitution above all else. 

I simply cannot say the same about Donald Trump. We must defeat him at the ballot box this November.

So here I am, a Republican asking millions of Democrats to donate today to reelect a Democratic president. Because I will always put America’s democracy and our Constitution first. Bo, will you join me by donating $74 or even more to directly support Team Biden-Harris?
