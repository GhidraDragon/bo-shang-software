Hi Ramona and Frank,

Fallon Health said in a letter dated 4/18/2023 that they will only cover Vyvanse on a "temporary" basis for 90 days unless I "try certain other drugs as part of what we call our step therapy program" or o see if there are safe and effective lower cost alternatives. When you get a chance could you please pass this onto Kim and advise me what to do?

Thanks so much,
Bo

I've attached the restraining order for my mom against my dad.

My dad was just upstairs within 10 yards of my mom when he asked me where I was going then angrily "forbid" me from taking my prescription meds and that it "only caused me problems". This is likely because he doesn't want me to have a clear head when dealing with his abuse. I told him he had no right to forbid me from taking my own prescriptions which was when he got even more angry and ordered me to leave the house. I asked him if he was sure he wanted me to leave so I could ask police to escort me out and prevent the violence and destruction of property my dad committed numerous times when he ordered me to leave the house. Then I got my phone out to record the fact that he was within 10 yards of my mom and upstairs, which was when he quickly went downstairs and said that I could leave "if I wanted to". This is another incidence of criminal harassment and I may need to actually report it ti the police then file my own restraining order. I don't believe leaving the house would be a major problem since I'd be eligible for victim/witness support, but I'd have to leave my mom alone with him when we both think he's still trying to find ways to abuse her.

The only good news from the Pharyngitis/Herpangina infection is that I haven't drank any alcohol for a week! 

I initially didn't drink because I wasn't able to tolerate it due to pain, but found that I'm able to sleep roughly around the same time anyways without the 2 beers before bedtime. Seems like the alcohol didn't really reduce anxiety or insomnia and I was just after a placebo effect. 

I am glad that I handled this high anxiety/pain situation without meds (besides ibuprofen/Tylenol) and it's great opportunity to quit alcohol! The pain has greatly subsided starting last night and this morning so I feel normal again.
