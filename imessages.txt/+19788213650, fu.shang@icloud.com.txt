Dad you need to download and activate the Safeco app by 4/15. You have 75 more days to “drive” the required 100 miles or something but you need to activate the application within the next 10 days

Dad should not drive in China because he does not have a driver’s license in China. I have asked to not list dad as a driver at the moment. I am not sure why his name is still listed in there.

Udacity only has 4 problems left and I went slowly to try to learn everything before writing high quality submissions only; ChatGPT is insanely useful for programming

May 03, 2023  3:18:20 PM
Me
I could finish Udacity before enrolling in that certificate, but the certificate isn’t charged monthly and is just 1 total cost

May 03, 2023  3:19:00 PM
Me
I figured the Udacity nano degree I’ll get in a few days + the certificate would at least get me into the post bac at Tufts where there’s a 20% alumni discount and is online, but you could switch to campus if you want

May 03, 2023  3:19:21 PM
Me
Then after doing well in the post bac I could get into MS, then go from there

May 03, 2023  3:19:53 PM

If GPT was available the last time I tried I definitely would have passed

May 03, 2023  3:21:09 PM
Me
I could probably even do it without adhd med if GPT is just that helpful. It’s not cheating; it actually explains everything you want to know then you could implement your own solution, but it tells you mostly what the solution is and explains perfectly

Also I didn’t get any sleep last night and don’t really feel like driving 45 mins each way. Could you please take an uber or Lyft?

May 03, 2023  3:36:45 PM

I could book it for you

May 03, 2023  3:43:53 PM

It’s probably like $8 in gas so we’d save $27 for 1.5 hours of driving

May 03, 2023  3:52:53 PM
Me
Yea now it’s like 45 mins with traffic and tolls

May 03, 2023  4:02:56 PM

Tolls are another $5.5 so you’d only save $20

Ramona said Pelmeds delayed again but I could probably pick up tomorrow morning.

Amazon went great and they even suggested that I apply to a more highly paid and more skill intensive customer facing position in Burlington. They have paid training for computer science and internal placements to software engineering jobs that prioritize existing Amazon employees.

The Tufts application is free for alumni so there’s no cost there. I just think it may help to finish the Udacity and CS50P certificates before applying for the post bac starting Summer 2023 starting May 30. I could enroll without being accepted first but I won’t be eligible for the 20% alumni scholarship and I think the price is higher and online option not available if I don’t get accepted first.

The MS application is also free but that wouldn’t happen until after I get As in two post bac courses, which are transferable to the MS.

So there’s no commitment to pay anything unless I get accepted and you agree to help fund. Right now I’ll wrap up Udacity ASAP for the certificate and also try to get at least 1 certificate in CS50P from Harvard before applying to the post bac probably next week. The $449 includes 3 separate individual class certificates, including CS50P, plus an additional “Professional Certificate in
Learning Python for Data Science” after you complete all 3. The paid enrollment means your work is actually graded so they could issue a verified certificate or professional certificate. I can’t submit the final project for CS50P until after paid enrollment or it won’t count and I’d have to submit everything again. The other 2 courses are actually highly relevant as well

I just paid the $447.3 so I could complete the certificates. Could you send me the $300 via Cash App as agreed? Dad will send me the other $147. Paying for this not only allows me to complete CS50P ASAP (while using the Udacity material for the final project at the same time) but also unlocked the CS109 data science course so I could refer to it as needed
