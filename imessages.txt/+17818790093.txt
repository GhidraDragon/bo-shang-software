Hi India, I plan to do a consultation with a psychiatrist who said he might be willing to switch me to 40mg of Adderall, which Ramona said was fine as long as it's only a consultation and I'm not prescribed anything.

Even if I'm offered a higher dose by another doctor I still may choose to stay with PACT because I find the other services PACT provide useful.

On an unrelated note I recently filed a police misconduct complaint which I think has merit and the Burlington Police Department is currently investigating. I plan to forward complaints to the DoJ because they sometimes offer relief to victims. 

I was wondering if I could email you the complaints so you could take a quick look at them? (If so what is your email?) I'm looking for a qualified lawyer to offer me private legal advice regarding this matter and I'm willing to pay a $5k retainer. Im not sure if anyone at PACT can help with this but I'm willing to pay an additional $1k for help in obtaining a qualified lawyer.

Thanks so much

Lastly can you please ask whoever is in charge of medical records how much it would cost to obtain an electronic copy of all of my medical records I’m entitled to receive under HIPAA? I’m not sure if PACT/Edinburgh charge a calculated fee or use a flat fee.

https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html

Also could someone at PACT inform me exactly which persons or entities currently or in the past has access to my HIPAA protected records, and whether each party has access because I expressly granted permission or due to another legal reason? 

Again I’m so sorry to bother you with these many texts and requests.

Sorry I forgot to include that Massachusetts law permits patient access to more medical records than only what's covered under HIPAA. 

https://www.mass.gov/service-details/medical-records-obligations

I'm sure the medical records person at PACT understands all relevant laws much better than I do. 

Thus I'd like to clarify that I'd like to know how much it would cost to obtain a copy of all medical records permitted by law and not just those covered under HIPAA

Mar 26, 2023  1:35:38 PM

I only mentioned "law" because technically a patient only has rights to some records, so I wanted to be accurate and not request "all" records. I did not mean to sound litigious.

Again so sorry for the texts but is it possible for someone quickly  to tell me or electronically send documents containing my specific diagnosis (if any exist) anyone may have made of me at PACT? If PACT has quick access to the Tewksbury diagnosis I’d like that as well.

I’m happy to pay whatever cost this may incur immediately by card or electronic transfer.

All of my previous providers maintain electronic systems with after visit summaries including any diagnosis made so I already have access to that.

Dear India, thanks so much for promptly taking care of my medical records requests.

To summarize everything else I wrote to you and Frank, I looked at what services PACT claims to offer 

https://www.edinburgcenter.org/program-for-assertive-community-treatment/

And wonder whether I can speak to a social worker, Frank (is he technically my “therapist” or not?), or a forensic specialist (I’m not sure what their job is at PACT) regarding my ongoing deep anxiety and trauma suffered over what I allege was gross violations of my civil rights by a member of the police department? 

This anxiety and trauma has and is preventing me from accomplishing essential life functions such as continuing to study software engineering or taking care of important personal and family matters.

I linked a letter I sent to the ACLU regarding the incidence that includes all relevant information. The letter is roughly 2 pages long.

Frank just texted saying he’s like to meet tomorrow. He’s technically a Substance Abuse Specialist and I was wondering if meeting with a social worker might be more medically appropriate given what I described?

I’ve agreed to meet with Frank and look forward to it but I was wondering if there was also a social worker available?

Also using official medical terms defined by PACT is Frank my “therapist” and does he perform “therapy” sessions with me when we meet? If not what is the correct term? I want to be 100% accurate if I need to describe my medical treatment with anyone in the future.

Thanks again

Regarding my medical record requests, before PACT had a chance to process my request for “all” records I have a legal right to obtain, which may take up to 30 days according to HIPAA, I’d like to clarify that if possible I’d like like to obtain a “list (accounting) of the times we’ve shared your health information for six years prior to the date you ask, who we shared it with, and why” as soon as possible, along with the short list of any documents containing my specific diagnosis I mentioned earlier.

According to Massachusetts Law, “Patients are entitled to a copy of their complete records, including records transferred from previous physicians.” 

Put in other words I’m entitled to complete records including any transferred to PACT from from Tewkesbury and any previous physicians or other sources.

I left a voicemail. Can I schedule an appointment to discuss this matter in person? The appointment would be about why Edinburgh does not give out records from other covered entities and also about correcting my records at Edinburgh with the actual records from MGH, Lahey, etc

I’m trying to get my records from Tewksbury but they are using any tactic to delay after I submitted a complaint. I’d like a copy of that discharge summary which again according to HIPAA I’m entitled to receive

Is there a vocational specialist at PACT yet? I’m looking for a part time job of around 10 hours a week to try to determine whether I’m able to work despite suffering from anxiety/panic, depression, ASD, and ADHD.

Hi India,

Is there any way to move my appointment with Pam to the Friday before or any time before because my 30 day supply of Vyvanse is scheduled to run out before the next appointment? Alternatively if she feels comfortable prescribing without seeing me I wouldn’t need to reschedule. Going a few days without Vyvanse wouldn’t be great but wouldn’t be the end of the world either.

Thanks so much,

BTW I believe that Pam Miller may be attempting to violate the due process clause of the 14th amendment intentionally so every session with her will be recorded with or without her consent; for example she kept blaming me for not holding my end of the bargain for Vyvanse for not taking invega which Ramona didn’t deliver etc then I paid out of pocket after scouring CVS

The Ambien was delivered at 10:23 by USPS and the Lahey notes were entered at like 2:30 or something so it’s very implausible to be out on the street purchasing it and test negative, etc. maybe I just wanted to sleep then use like prescription Vyvanse which I still had quite a bit at the time to work on stuff

Representative Greene could you help me with exposing myself on Twitch?

Dear Representative Greene,

I unfortunately watched Twitch and read Pokimane's "undying love and appreciation" "contract" then believed in it enough. Later I thought it was a good idea to attempt to impress her by masterbating while pointing a camera at my wiener then upload it to Pornhub. I have several thousand views now https://www.pornhub.com/video/search?search=pokimane

I heard that 18 U.S. Code § 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television made it criminally illegal for anyone in the United States to devise or intend to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud (https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-1034014607-980273003&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:63:section:1343), or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme.

I was wondering if you could help?

Sincerely,
Davenport Knights

PS I was wondering if you knew what your social media may have in common with Osama Bin Laden’s 2002 Letter addressed to Americans? Well roughly half of your tweets are hateful propaganda that may confuse people and lead to real violence. Bin Laden also wrote something similar but that he had the right to seek revenge against his murderer. In the United States, the Second Amendment “guarantees” (lol) that a “well regulated Militia, being nece
ssary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Do you notice some logic between your tweets and Bin Laden’s 2002 letter?
