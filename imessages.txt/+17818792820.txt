Hi Frank. Thanks for the well wishes. I was wondering if you know the PACT policies of seeing other physicians or about rejoining PACT if a physician doesn't work out? Dr Harrison's prescription of 70mg/day has been incredibly helpful compared to the baseline but it still leaves me feeling like half a productive person. My Oreo

Mar 22, 2023  9:10:21 AM
Me
Sorry last 2 words were typos

Mar 22, 2023  9:12:00 AM
Me
However my previous 2 prescriptions for 100 mg Vyvanse+10 mg Dexedrine and 60mg Adderall (2 separate prescriptions) were much more beneficial and made me feel productive each day.

Mar 22, 2023  9:13:34 AM
Me
I've looked around for alternative doctors but most are not masshealth practitioners which means I'd have to pay out of pocket for both medication and appointments.

Mar 22, 2023  9:15:43 AM
Me
However a doctor willing to switch me to my previous prescriptions or something similar would have great benefits to my life by helping me catch up to my peers and landing a job. I don't want a lack of medication or inability to pay for it make me give up my dream career path.

Mar 22, 2023  9:16:43 AM
Me
Therefore I was wondering if PACT allows for consultation with other doctors and if it doesn't work well would I still be eligible to stay in PACT?

Mar 22, 2023  9:19:53 AM
Me
Also can you please share this information with Dr Harrison to see if she's willing to do the increase (which means switching to Adderall if she wants to keep the FDA recommended dose). I would be willing to give my medication to my mom as well as keep a detailed log of my daily accomplishments in work for both the doctor to see and my Mom to verify. This would ensure I'm not misusing the drug.

Mar 22, 2023  9:21:23 AM
Me
Taking this drug feels like my only hope in life to realize my long held goals instead of giving up and accepting a low skill job, so these questions are incredibly important to me.

Mar 24, 2023  5:57:42 PM
Me
Hi Frank, I plan to do a consultation with a psychiatrist who said he might be willing to switch me to 40mg of Adderall, which Ramona said was fine as long as it's only a consultation and I'm not prescribed anything.

Even if I'm offered a higher dose by another doctor I still may choose to stay with PACT because I find the other services PACT provide useful.

On an unrelated note I recently filed a police misconduct complaint which I think has merit and the Burlington Police Department is currently investigating. I plan to forward complaints to the DoJ because they sometimes offer relief to victims. 

I was wondering if I could email you the complaints so you could take a quick look at them? (If so what is your email?) I'm looking for a qualified lawyer to offer me private legal advice regarding this matter and I'm willing to pay a $5k retainer. Im not sure if anyone at PACT can help with this but I'm willing to pay an additional $1k for help in obtaining a qualified lawyer.

Thanks so much

I’ve put the information and evidence on Google Drive.

There’s approximately 5 pages of information and evidence in total. 

The alleged police misconduct has caused me a great deal of trauma and I’d highly appreciate it if you could could pass along this information to someone qualified who may be able to help. None of the information is protected under any privacy law and you may share this link with anyone you like.

Thanks so much, Bo

Also I understand theres always a justifiable worry about people with previous mental health problems who bring up something unusual like this. 

It may be responsible to at least glance at the information I provided to ensure there's no psychosis or other medical problems, which there are clearly not. 

I voluntarily disclosed to the public on Google Drive only a tiny bit of medical information to establish my rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. For medical information I did not voluntarily disclose I request PACT adhere to HIPAA regulations.

Mar 26, 2023 10:29:54 AM
Me
Also I know there a time zone difference since I'm in Turkey right now but is there any way to schedule a virtual therapy session at our usual time or whenever you're available? 

Again I felt a lot of trauma over what I allege was police misconduct and would like to talk about it. 

If my mother is available (I don't want to interfere with her vacation) I'd be happy to invite her to the session. She was a witness in my allegations and has issued written statements to the police supporting my claims.

Lastly can you please ask whoever is in charge of medical records how much it would cost to obtain an electronic copy of all of my medical records I’m entitled to receive under HIPAA? I’m not sure if PACT/Edinburgh charge a calculated fee or use a flat fee.

https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html

Also could someone at PACT inform me exactly which persons or entities currently or in the past has access to my HIPAA protected records, and whether each party has access because I expressly granted permission or due to another legal reason? 

Again I’m so sorry to bother you with these many texts and requests.

Mar 26, 2023  1:09:08 PM

Sorry I forgot to include that Massachusetts law permits patient access to more medical records than only what's covered under HIPAA. 

https://www.mass.gov/service-details/medical-records-obligations

I'm sure the medical records person at PACT understands all relevant laws much better than I do. 

Thus I'd like to clarify that I'd like to know how much it would cost to obtain a copy of all medical records permitted by law and not just those covered under HIPAA

Mar 26, 2023  1:35:25 PM

I only mentioned "law" because technically a patient only has rights to some records, so I wanted to be accurate and not request "all" records. I did not mean to sound litigious.

Again so sorry for the texts but is it possible for someone quickly  to tell me or electronically send documents containing my specific diagnosis (if any exist) anyone may have made of me at PACT? If PACT has quick access to the Tewksbury diagnosis I’d like that as well.

I’m happy to pay whatever cost this may incur immediately by card or electronic transfer.

All of my previous providers maintain electronic systems with after visit summaries including any diagnosis made so I already have access to that.

I'd highly appreciate it if you can read the letter before our meeting. 

If you want even more details there's a Google Drive link in the letter containing official correspondence with the police as well as my mother's witness statements detailing what happened.

Thanks again and talk to you soon,

Since you're a "substance abuse specialist" I'd like to submit a voluntary "medication count check" to prove I have been taking the medication exactly as prescribed. I'd be willing to voluntarily submit to weekly or daily checks in the future, or ask my mother to do so for me, to prove I am in 100% compliance with PACT's treatment plan. I would appreciate it if you could include this information in my medical records.

Mar 28, 2023  2:48:39 AM

This information may be helpful for PACT physicians to know because while the 70mg of Vyvanse is extremely helpful in getting study/work/personal health done, I still have strong evidence which people who interact with me can confirm that I cannot focus nearly as well as peers with similar standardized/IQ testing results and education levels, and that ADHD still presents a strong deficiency despite the medication. I know medication can't solve everything but I have been prescribed much more Vyvanse, Adderall, or Dexedrine in the past at MGH and Commonwealth Psychology and another practice I cannot remember the name of.

Mar 28, 2023  3:10:24 AM
Me
By “much more” I meant “A 30 mg dose of Vyvanse is equal (https://www.uacap.org/uploads/3/2/5/0/3250432/stimulant_equivalency.pdf)
 to 8.85 mg of d-amphetamine or 11.8 mg of Adderall.”

Again sorry for the texts but I just wanted to clarify what I meant.

Regarding my medical record requests, before PACT had a chance to process my request for “all” records I have a legal right to obtain, which may take up to 30 days according to HIPAA, I’d like to clarify that if possible I’d like like to obtain a “list (accounting) of the times we’ve shared your health information for six years prior to the date you ask, who we shared it with, and why” as soon as possible, along with the short list of any documents containing my specific diagnosis I mentioned earlier.

Dear Frank,

I’m submitting a format medical record request by email as you instructed. Please email me electronic copies of the records I request below as soon as it’s available. My 4 specific requests are in bold.

My first request is to immediately revoke any HIPPA authorizations I previously have given any persons or entities to access my protected medical information stored at PACT.

According to Federal Law found on the HHS Government website below, “You can ask for a list (accounting) of the times we’ve shared your health information for six years prior to the date you ask, who we shared it with, and why.

https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/npp_fullpg_healthplan.pdf (https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/npp_fullpg_healthplan.pdf)

My second request is to obtain a list (accounting) of the times PACT shared my health information for six years prior to today, who PACT shared it with, and why. This is legally urgent as I want to verify any legal statements I make accusation Burlington Police Department of never having access to my records is true.

According to Massachusetts Law, “Patients are entitled to a copy of their complete records, including records transferred from previous physicians.” (For me this would include any records transferred from Tewkesbury or anywhere else PACT has obtained medical records from)

https://www.mass.gov/service-details/medical-records-obligations (https://www.mass.gov/service-details/medical-records-obligations)

Additionally according to Massachusetts Law,,“ Physicians who are providing psychotherapy services should, when appropriate, provide full records to their patients. However, if, in the physician’s reasonable judgment, providing the entire medical record would adversely affect the patient’s well-being, the provider may provide a summary of the record.”

My 3rd request is to obtain a copy of ALL the records I’m entitled to under all relevant laws. I know this may take a while HIPAA allows up too 30 days by default to process this request.


My 4th medically urgent request is to obtain an electronic copy of the most recent official diagnosis of my conditions Frank, Dr Harrison, or Nick may have made of me. I need this information ASAP to discuss my medical situation with the “second opinion” doctor, as well as to verify any legal statements I make to government or private lawyers is fully accurate. If you can include the most recent Tewkesbury diagnosis that would be helpful as well. According to HIPAA medical records relating to urgent medical needs should
 be made available ASAP.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I submitted this request improperly in any way.

Thanks and best regards,
Bo

India asked me to fill an Edinburgh form specifying which PHI to request so I won't request everything if it's inconvenient 

Mar 29, 2023  9:35:05 AM
Me
Also is it inconvenient to request “all” records allowed by law? I don’t want PACT to have to go through everything to determine whether each document would compromise quality of care if released. I also don’t want anyone who writes notes informally to have to include that.

Mar 30, 2023  2:16:32 AM
Me
I only requested a recent summary of mental health assessment and specific diagnosis. I didn't want to include psychotherapy notes because I believe therapists have a reasonable expectation of privacy to them, even if under MA law they're obligated to disclose if asked. I've emailed you and India the request. 

Thanks again

Hi Frank. I just want to let you know that the delay of the Edinburgh pharmacy and staff for medication is really a problem when there's a gap a doctor didn't intend in my medication. I attached 2 screenshots of texts with Ramona explaining what happened

Apr 06, 2023 11:26:23 AM
Me
If Edinburgh can reliably deliver it every week then I'd prefer that because it reduces risk of me losing the medication somehow. But the 2 4-5 day gaps the doctor never intended over 4 months i experienced due to problems with the pharmacy or delivery is harming my ability to find a decent job asap

Apr 07, 2023  1:35:29 PM

To summarize my voicemail:

The part of my medical record in Edinburgh center from before I started at Edinburgh is incredibly inaccurate and totally falsified in many ways. That part was likely copy and pasted from a summary Dr Leonard Lai from Tewksbury wrote. I can provide Edinburgh with electronic access to my MGH and Lahey portals along with other official medical records which refute most of the claims made my Dr Lai. I’d like to have this issue resolved before my first meeting with Kim next week if possible. 

Apr 07, 2023  2:49:36 PM
Me
Next Tuesday I'd like to discuss the Tewksbury Discharge Summary which contained wildly inaccurate information, Edinburgh's own summary of it, and provide you the user name and password to my Lahey and MGH portals which refute the claims made my Tewksbury.

Apr 07, 2023  4:44:42 PM

The primary diagnosis F20.9 was probably copied from the Tewksbury discharge summary which was inaccurate, and should be especially obvious to Edinburgh now that nobody has reported seeing me with any psychotic symptoms for over 2 years. I am also willing to testify under oath in potential legal action against Tewksbury that I only experienced several relatively minor psychotic episodes caused by the misuse of medication, the first of which was Nov 18 and the last in Oct 20 with 3-4 in between. I experienced no psychosis before Nov 18 or after Oct 20 and am extremely sure of that now partly I have personal experience in what psychosis actually is

Apr 07, 2023  4:48:37 PM
Me
I never met the definition of Z65.1 whatsoever since I've never been to jail or convicted of a crime. If Edinburgh was referring to my stay at Tewksbury when creating that diagnosis it would be inaccurate to begin with as far as I read and definitely wouldn't be a "current" diagnosis

Apr 07, 2023  5:27:24 PM
Me
I'm also concerned that Edinburgh's records about me from the past only contained a lot of untrue negative information obtained via the Tewksbury Discharge Summary. It didnt include the incredibly effective adhd treatment I received from Aug 17 to Nov 18, which I can support with medical records from MGH and academic transcripts. It also doesn't include my entire life's history of struggling with untreated anxiety/panic, adhd, depression, and ASD which was detailed in the neuropsych evaluation but since it was untreated there's not much other medical records, although I can provide supporting evidence with other types of records.

Also the second opinion provider said he will provide me with an after visit summary with his opinions by tomorrow morning hopefully in time to see Kim. I’d also like to bring in 1.5 years of medical records from MGH and other places describing very successful treatment for the conditions that I suffered through my entire life but was only properly treated for 2 years of, including the past 6 months at Edinburgh. I feel like it’s impossible to obtain gainful employment without proper treatment for my conditions which Dr Harrison, MGH, and a few other doctors were thankfully able to do for me.

Apr 11, 2023  2:15:18 PM
Me
Also I was informed by the second opinion provider to make sure to be totally sure that a prescribed is OK with giving me a little “flexibility” in taking ADHD medication like I mentioned to you earlier before after doing it. I thought that it was typical of prescribers to give people a little flexibility because I was told that in the past at MGH, but I will be 100% sure not to take more than prescribed unless given explicit permission to do so in the future. My mom is monitoring my medication daily as well as well being and will continue reporting to Frank every week.

Meeting with both Kim and "second opinion" provider went well. A lot of anxiety removed about current treatment but still need to add missing or attempt to fix inaccurate medical records in case I find a job in another state and have to switch providers. Also need to fix credit history and continue progress in school and work projects especially to show working/useful program on resume to fill in the resume gap. Meeting with Mass Rehabilitation tomorrow to help me find a ~10 hour a week job to help prove that I'm able to work despite these conditions and also to make a little income.

Tewksbury just emailed me saying they're sending the information by CD for free, possibly because I noticed numerous HIPAA violations and threatened to file a complaint if they didn't let me scan the records for myself for free as required by HIPAA. Hopefully this will contain most of my previous medical records as well. I'm doing great been productive and helpful to family and improved my family relationships as well over the past week.

Spoke with government referred (from MA state gov website) non profit that specializes in credit advice and debt management. Was told that score only counts recent 2 years for the most part. Was offered a gov sanctioned repayment plan that the banks already legally agreed to, but will check billing statements for accuracy and dispute invalid activity first (since I called to cancel and report lost card when I lost them in hospital, but was told I couldn't authenticate myself to access accounts; also for some reason there's an ambulance service collection on the report which should be covered by masshealth by law, etc.)

Bressler at MGH just called and sent a message. They said they offered the One Time Consult "by mistake" because they didn't realize I was a former patient when I submitted the consultation request and that they're "unable to move forward with the clinical intake process as you were previously seen at the clinic and dismissed." 

They said I needed to contact medical records to obtain the notes regarding the "dismissal" (they wouldn't confirm they exist) since nobody ever informed me of the dismissal and I remember voluntarily not making a follow up after the 9/13/2019 appointment because there was a $438.25 bill on my account after that visit because my student insurance plan had expired in June 2019. 

It seems trying to even get second consults after making the mistakes I made from Nov 2018 - June 2020 is very difficult. Of course those mistakes also influence my present treatment at Edinburg. 

If possible next Tuesday I'd like to discuss potential ways coping with the anxiety of having this negative "stigma" attached to me (which I assume will be impactful for at least another couple of years) and feasible methods for possibly overcoming the challenge that many providers may refuse to see me at all and providers who do may be extra "cautious" in their actions or even (subconsciously or not) be more likely to note and consider any red flags that they may detect. 

I'm also not sure if providers would classify me as displaying drug seeking behavior whenever I see I describe psychological symptoms (anxiety) to my PCP or seek second opinions. I think seeing your PCP when psychiatric practitioner is not available is very common.

Finally Kim encouraged me to share as much as possible and William Garrett "thanked" me for not oversharing. When I don't voluntarily say much during appointments, I've been labeled as "guarded" or "not forthcoming" regarding past mistakes. When I do share I'm labeled as having a "circumstantial and tangential thought process," having "ruminations" about medication, and having both "fair" and "poor" judgement at the same time, etc.

I'm really not sure what the best course of action is regarding whether to discuss the past or seek second opinions etc are. Perhaps I need to be factual and reasonably complete but also extremely concise. But if I draft a concise statement people may think I'm "blunted" or display some other type oddity. I remember being labeled as "within normal limits" for roughly everything before i made the series of mistakes from Nov 18 - June 20. From June 17 - Oct 18, every appointment wS short and I simply answered basic questions to receive what I think was basically optimal treatment. I think I'm receiving near optimal treatment now as well but this stigma is just causing me a lot of anxiety.

Apr 25, 2023  5:17:39 PM
Me
I guess I'm trying to adopt behavioral strategies that make me feel less anxious and portray me as "normal" to others especially in employment. Adopting these strategies would certainly reduce ADHD symptoms, anxiety, and depression.

For example Im trying to figure out how not to portray both anxiety and drive to improve my situation (partly caused by the anxiety) as possible "mania." It's in my interest to realize when Im anxious then try to calm down before engaging with other people, etc. I've definitely said too many "weird" things while anxious then later regret because it feels too awkward.

Apr 25, 2023  5:43:15 PM
Me
Suggesting that I may be experiencing manic behavior definitely helps because I use often rely on these types of feedback to remind to calm myself down when anxious and not try to take on extra tasks I dont need that cause stress.

 Now MGH Bressler is offering the One Time Consult again after I threatened to file a complaint with MGH about the likely false information she provided me about how I was "dismissed." I told her I was pretty sure there exist no medical records regarding the dismissal which if true would have been documented at 9/13/2019 during my last visit or within a few months after, then asked her to provide roughly the date and reason for the dismissal. I also told her about hours my mom and I wasted filling out the questionnaire and having to inform my current provider (Edinburgh)about both the Consult and then the cancellation. 

Now apparently I'm updating you that they reversed their decision once again. She said she spoke with the doctor about this complaint I threatened to file and the doctor agreed to the One Time Consult. It's so dumb how you have to keep threatening to file complaints to get people to do what they're contractually or legally obligated to do.

She said she didn't feel safe at home so went to stay with my aunt and uncle. My dad called the police to report her missing yesterday for some reason.

Apparently I have to go to court tomorrow to petition that a judge orders some mental health treatment. He has refused to see any mental health practitioner his entire life and as someone who's gone through the process and done extensive research, I've identified several treatable possible conditions that he may have. This has been a gigantic waste of time for me. I successfully completed around 1/3 of an entire course on Friday but had to spend Saturday and Sunday literally protecting my mom. I had to email 2 recruiters about this saying the earliest I could update my resume and code sample is Tuesday (since there's a 4 hour National Guard Army standardized test on Monday, which apparently they also put you in a hotel for)

May 07, 2023 10:22:56 PM

My mom wants a "quick" divorce so my dad "isn't her problem" but I want the best for him and want to get at least initial mental health evaluations for him.

I'll try my best to use existing medication (1 Vyvanse a day and not any more whatsoever plus the Ambien which I had from the start of the month but ran out since she only prescribed 10) to deal with everything. I very carefully as doctors to prescribe daily sleep meds that I got from MGH in 2017 - 2019, which was lunesta 2mg and was very effective. I know adhd meds counter sleep meds, but they are also taken at the same time. I may very carefully request an increase to 80mg over time. Many doctors seem to think im a full of shit drug addict after reading the Tewksbury Discharge Summary, but I managed to convince Dr Ceranoglu that im again responsible (perhaps even more so this time, because I know I'll never make the mistakes I made before simply because I realized that it obviously does more harm than good) I'm hoping to build a better with Kim as well. I don't think it was fair for her to rate my "judgment

May 07, 2023 10:48:54 PM
Me
as both "fair" and "poor" on the ratings sheet. I'm 100% confident that after a doctor meets with me a few times, rather than rely on the misleading Tewksbury Discharge
Summary, that any reasonable doctor would understand my reasonings

May 07, 2023 10:51:42 PM
Me
It's just over the past 3 months my judgement has been ridiculously spot on, both in interpersonal, professional, and legal/medical. I'm not manic when I say this but I believe that if Kim gives me 2 sessions to explain, then I could convince her to take off the "poor" part of the judgement. I'm happy to take "fair" which was what Dr Harrison the previous doctor rated me the entire time

May 07, 2023 10:53:28 PM

I've never got along better with BPD after filing that complaint; I think the complaint is actually helping them check compliance, and every officer I saw afterwards treated me with a lot of respect that I reciprocated

Sorry I drank 3 beers last night after my dad was arrested to reduce anxiety and related insomnia, and as a result wrote too many somewhat incoherent messages to you. I didn't realize how the alcohol would affect me and will be careful with it in the future

May 08, 2023  7:00:41 AM
Me
I'm rational so after I even get a hint of problems caused by substances (3 beers in this case) I do not repeat the same mistakes. The incoherent messages I sent last night were atypical of me. The messages I sent in the morning asking whether I should report to police were typical and rational.

May 08, 2023  7:22:08 AM
Me
Regarding the incoherent medication part of last night's texts, I had 1.5 years of experience on either prescriptions of 45-60mg Adderall daily or 100mg Vyvanse + 10mg Dexedrine daily prescribed from June 2017 - Nov 2018. At MGH I was also prescribed *daily* (30 doses per 28 day refill) non benzodiazepine hypnotics (zaleplon then lunesta) for 1 year. I did not attempt to acquire additional non prescribed meds at the time. (The worst decision of my life to attempt to acquire some small amounts of additional of the "same" meds that i have been prescribed started in Nov 18 and ended in May 20. I only attempted to acquire small amounts at a time because they were only intended for personal consumption and I wanted to avoid any possibility of being accused of intent to distribute. I am comfortable admitting this because the statute of limitations has passed. This was the only illegal activity that I knew I was doing my entire life.) The Adderall or Vyvanse 100mg + Dexedrine 10mg prescriptions work better than the 70mg of Vyvanse I'm on now. I had to tell 2 recruiters that I spent all weekend dealing with a domestic violence issue so wasn't able to update my resume and github code sample as promised. That's what caused me to bring up medication concerns because I felt anxious I wasn't able to get enough done. I am mostly aware of possible side effects of legally prescribed or legally obtained "medication" (beer) but apparently I got too "drunk?" last night and sent incoherent messages. I won't repeat the same mistake

May 08, 2023  3:06:37 PM
Me
But I think it's more prudent to not "request" an increase in medications so soon; I'll try to do the best I can at current doses 

May 08, 2023  3:08:11 PM
Me
It's just really frustrating how my mom asked me to "protect" her because she was unwilling to directly communicate with the police and wasted like 4 days of mine as a result.

May 08, 2023  3:10:10 PM
Me
I just got overly excited that my "hunch" about what my dad would do was somehow spot on last night; that and the beer caused me to act stupidly in the texts 

May 08, 2023  3:18:57 PM
Me
It was "euphoric" which i guess was partly caused by the alcohol and partly caused by my tips to the police literally playing out exactly according to my hunches. That led me to stupid "euphoric" beliefs about everything else which I shared. I will learn from this instance. Also I will stop sending way way too many texts

May 08, 2023  3:37:27 PM
Me
I am really disappointed in myself every time I make a mistake I either made before or could reasonably expect to avoid without prior experience. I received too much praise from church leaders, my mom, and police for "doing the right thing" yesterday and it got to my head. Normally 3 beers don't cause euphoria 

May 08, 2023  7:26:01 PM
Me
Actually after doing more research, while this may not be in my self interest to admit to, especially since I drank 3 beers last night, the "euphoric" delusions of grandeur was almost certainly contributed by 10mg of Ambien. The euphoric effects are very rare (perhaps 1/20 uses), and any delusional beliefs including delusions of grandeur is even more rare. Usually when the euphoric side effects happen I just feel a bit funny before falling asleep so there's no harm done. 

The medication is much more beneficial than harmful, but I do realize the strong incentives for using as little as possible (ADHD, sleep meds, and alcohol, etc) to achieve a minimally reasonably fulfilling life. I fully realize these medications are designed to and only approved for reducing medical deficits rather than performance enhancement. I fully realize negative results of overuse beyond minimally appropriate may include the potential for tolerance, dependencies, and other labeled side effects. I fully realize it's not recommended to use Ambien and alcohol at the same time.

The last time this type of disturbance happened to my life, while I was prescribed ADHD meds, was in Nov 18 when I tried to acquire more "adderall" online to make up for the disturbances other people caused me, or at that time possibly caused by myself too. I'm definitely not making that mistake again. I'm wondering if you think it may be beneficial to describe my anxiety and concentration problems to the ER? A blood test will show that I'm 100% complaint with the Vyvanse, not taking any other substances, but that it's not having desired effects (enough of an effect) of me doing a fulfilling life. I need a blood test anyways from PCP so maybe the ER could do it?

May 09, 2023  8:00:30 AM
Me
I believe they call this an "early warning sign" that I was able to successfully identify 

May 09, 2023  8:00:50 AM
Me
My judgement is not poor despite what Kim said about me in the last report 

May 09, 2023  8:07:00 AM
Me
I am curious why Kim told to Dr Sakr about the Xanax prescription. Why did he say that it was inappropriate? I think Xanax is inferior to ADHD med for my type of anxiety and may counter the effects of Vyvanse, so I took it at night while alternating from Ambien. Typically alternating between sleep meds is more effective than taking 1 type over multiple days

May 09, 2023  8:10:43 AM
Me
Can you ask Kim if she prefers a blood test before tomorrow's appointment? I plan to go to ER so I can describe concentration and related anxiety rather than normal blood lab because there're no doctor at normal blood lab

May 09, 2023  8:16:50 AM
Me
Obviously it's times like this when taking 2 Vyvanse is temping but I learned from that too

May 09, 2023  8:18:17 AM
Me
But like wtf am I supposed to do to keep up with obligations when disturbances that's not my fault cause problems and ADHD meds are not at optimal dosing yet. (Compared to 2017-2018 at 45-60mg Adderall or 100mg Vyvanse + 10mg Dexedrine)

May 10, 2023  2:02:41 PM
Me
Meeting with Kim went every well. She addressed every one of my questions and we agreed on everything after each side had a chance to explain. My dad is still causing lots of stress because now he's saying he doesn't care what happens in his criminal trial and doesn't care if he goes to jail. I had to call the victims advocate to advocate his rights on his behalf because for one thing he thinks he can represent himself when he's literally delusional and has no idea what he's doing. A judge allowing him to represent himself would certainly be a violation of his 6th amendment rights guarantee everyone to informed choices regarding representation

Hi Frank,

I had an initial evaluation as a new patient with a new PCP with De Wei Yang. The reason for switching is that Dr Yang is a family friend and a former colleague of my mother, so is more likely to provide better personalized care compared to previous/current (I guess) PCP. She’s also highly intelligent and part of the Harvard Vanguard network so she was able to refer me to in-network nutritionists and second opinion behavioral health. (I’ve yet to schedule an appointment but got the referrals) Dr Yang suggested that Phentermine may be appropriate for weight loss (blood pressure, heart rate, and EKG was fine; blood test tomorrow morning) but she should coordinate with Kim regarding Vyvanse + Phentermine. I mentioned to Dr Yang that I was on 100mg Vyvanse + 10mg Dexedrine daily from MGH for a year, and before misuse/abuse of medication my health records, vitals, blood tests, and other tests were fine on a higher dose of stimulants, so the Phentermine was likely fine. Dr Yang said she may start the Phentermine next month after she reviews my blood test scheduled for 8am tomorrow.

Kim said she renewed 10 Ambien to CVS and 30 Vyvanse to Pelmeds to be distributed however Ramona wanted; so I guess she could give me 6 or 8 at a time, etc.

May 10, 2023  5:06:34 PM
Me
Dr Yang asked if I wanted her to take over the psychiatric meds and I answered no. I instead asked for referrals for in-network (free) second opinions to Harvard Vanguard behavioral health. I was honest about my medical records including misuse/abuse from Nov 18 - June 20. I was also honest about hospitalizations. Dr Yang did not believe I have substance abuse or other mental health concerns presently and only referred me for ADHD, anxiety, and possible depression. (ASD was not a choice in the referral, but these 4 diagnosis is consistent with my Sep 2017 neuropsych evaluation, MGH health records, and the opinions of Frank and Nick) Kim also said she would look into updating my diagnosis since they were written on Tewksbury Discharge Summary before Edinburg ever got a chance to see me, and was never updated. Dr Yang said it may be appropriate to ask Kim for “anxiety medication” for my Dad’s behavior but she didn’t want to step in Kim’s foot for now since I asked Dr Yang to not take over my psychiatric meds. I presume Dr Yang was referring to the 3-day supply of very low dose of Xanax my PCP prescribed last month, but while I won’t say no to a prescription, I also don’t believe it’s necessary. I believe most anxiety is caused by concentration problems including concentration required to deal with my dad’s legal issues. I’m just being transparent in reporting all of this since it’s what Kim suggested.

But my dad is still insane and causing a lot of anxiety. Eg he says "he doesn't care what happens in the trial", "doesn't care if he goes to jail", and thinks he should represent himself in violation of his own 6th amendment rights.

I suffered a lot of PTSD in the past week so I decided to write scripts that auto downloads literally all laws + publicly available case laws, analyzes and learn concepts behind the laws using large language machine learning models, take in user descriptions/complaints/evidence, then tries to determine which laws may have been violated. I also built features to auto-report possible criminal violations to the police. 

https://github.com/bshang165

My dad is unfortunately *still* causing problems (I hear him angrily yelling at my mom just now) but I am happy with the professional progress I've made in recent days.

I still think it's medically appropriate for Kim should move me back to the Commonwealth Psychology then MGH prescriptions sooner rather than later, but making this progress has removed temptation to repeat past mistakes of acquiring illicit ADHD medication to make up for attention problems caused by other people's abuse.

May 15, 2023  6:09:01 PM
Me
By "large language models", I meant that I'm building my own for things existing services cannot do, but for most cases I'm using OpenAI's API to leverage their models. I was also invited as an early developer to build a plug-in, but haven't submitted the plug-in for review yet.

https://github.com/bshang165

I'm getting a ton of recruiter interest and have the ability to literally auto search for every job opening in the US then intelligently auto apply for literally everything, so if my health holds up I don't think I'll have problems getting a job.

May 15, 2023  6:23:37 PM

Also I specifically asked Kim last time whether it'd be appropriate to accept prescriptions from other doctors if I'm honest (eg a Xanax renewal from Dr Sakr) and she said it was medically appropriate. I'm glad CVS finally got the prescription and that I could pick up tonight or tomorrow.

Sorry my Mom sent me to Lahey ED cuz I used Ambien during the day (which is very rare) to get pass the previous withdrawal period and have a great start to the next day. However I never really woke up at Ambien ED and forgot what I said since I was sleepwalking. They gave me a Section 7B which im serving now at Bayrjdge. Should expire by Friday.

So do you know anything that's possibly true? And obviously the s talk with Apple support may be tunnel vision amphetamine but I took maybe 2 concerta ? Or I'm lying.. then just use your professional judgement to say I might be lying or hate more... anyways you're fine with it without knowing what exactly is happening? 🤔 did I disclose a joke that the Uighur thing was to follow the law only. Also is the intelligence apparatus or show the source anyways ... anyways r u ok with this ?

Things are not as simple as they seem. This is what I have to deal with in life so sometimes I had to order illicit medication to cover. Feel free to inform Burlington Police about this. I do not believe they'll charge me or Section 12 me.

BTW ordered exactly 35 more "Adderalls" but from a more reputable vendor with thousands of 5 star reviews to replace what you illegally stole. You are free to inform the police about this as well and I do not believe they'll charge me with possession given the legal facts of what you did. I'd be happy to provide a screenshot and when it was delivered etc. I learned that as long as I don't infringe on the rights of others nothing criminally could happen to me in America basically 

If Dr Kim prescribes more tomorrow what you illegally stole, I'll hand over the 35 ordered to the police; you have me on record

I did tell Dr Kim I had occasionally ordered in the past to get by criminal violations against me which strikes true again. Dad charged with A&B against me 6 months ago and Summons by Middlesex DA Marin Ryan regarding a separate A&B in June 24 with intent to rape. I will not be witness intimidated anymore

After my cousin stole roughly $2k in cash (given back to me), a $2k Apple  M3 Pro went missing, and roughly 60 of my legally valid prescription medication of controlled substances, I ordered 35 “illicit” (but plan to challenge as legally not for me in this situation by citing numerous Consitutional supercede precedences) Adderall to replace what she stole. I also have an appt with my psychiatrist tomorrow and if he prescribes what she stole to make up for it, I’ll turn the 35 ordered to the police as promised on record. I’m citing numerous Constiutional arguments namely the 1st 14th but most intriguingly 2nd to “bear illicit Adderall” for self defense im eager to see play out in court
