Folks, can I get your eyes on this? 

It's Jill Biden here. Our campaign is just two days away from our February fundraising deadline, and we need your help.  

Donald Trump was the winner of the Republican primary in South Carolina by a landslide and is now one step closer to becoming Republicans' official nominee. 

Joe and Kamala need supporters like you to dig deep at this moment because there's really no other choice. We cannot afford to let Donald Trump win.

President Clinton here. How would you like to meet President Biden, President Obama, and me?

If you make a contribution of $25 -- or any amount that's meaningful to you -- to support President Biden's reelection campaign and Democrats nationwide, you'll be automatically entered for a chance to meet all three of us.
